00615f2f-537d-4c62-b402-d0260ae02531,Towards Safe Concept Transfer of Multi-Modal Diffusion via Causal Representation Editing,"Peiran Dong, Bingjie Wang, Song Guo, Junxiao Wang, Jie Zhang, Zicong Hong","Recent advancements in vision-language-to-image (VL2I) diffusion generation have made significant progress. While generating images from broad vision-language inputs holds promise, it also raises concerns about potential misuse, such as copying artistic styles without permission, which could have legal and social consequences. Therefore, it's crucial to establish governance frameworks to ensure ethical and copyright integrity, especially with widely used diffusion models. To address these issues, researchers have explored various approaches, such as dataset filtering, adversarial perturbations, machine unlearning, and inference-time refusals. However, these methods often lack either scalability or effectiveness. In response, we propose a new framework called causal representation editing (CRE), which extends representation editing from large language models (LLMs) to diffusion-based models. CRE enhances the efficiency and flexibility of safe content generation by intervening at diffusion timesteps causally linked to unsafe concepts. This allows for precise removal of harmful content while preserving acceptable content quality, demonstrating superior effectiveness, precision and scalability compared to existing methods. CRE can handle complex scenarios, including incomplete or blurred representations of unsafe concepts, offering a promising solution to challenges in managing harmful content generation in diffusion-based models.",2024-12-16,2,NeurIPS

However, their performance is upper-bounded by constrained 3D priors due to the lack of scalable learning paradigms. In this work, we present See3D, a visual-conditional multi-view diffusion model trained on large-scale Internet videos for open-world 3D creation. The model aims to Get 3D knowledge by solely Seeing the visual contents from the vast and rapidly growing video data -- You See it, You Got it. To achieve this, we first scale up the training data using a proposed data curation pipeline that automatically filters out multi-view inconsistencies and insufficient observations from source videos. This results in a high-quality, richly diverse, large-scale dataset of multi-view images, termed WebVi3D, containing 320M frames from 16M video clips. Nevertheless, learning generic 3D priors from videos without explicit 3D geometry or camera pose annotations is nontrivial, and annotating poses for web-scale videos is prohibitively expensive. To eliminate the need for pose conditions, we introduce an innovative visual-condition - a purely 2D-inductive visual signal generated by adding time-dependent noise to the masked video data. Finally, we introduce a novel visual-conditional 3D generation framework by integrating See3D into a warping-based pipeline for high-fidelity 3D generation. Our numerical and visual comparisons on single and sparse reconstruction benchmarks show that See3D, trained on cost-effective and scalable video data, achieves notable zero-shot and open-world generation capabilities, markedly outperforming models trained on costly and constrained 3D datasets.

We introduce two datasets, OmniSim and InterReal, featuring 28 scenes with multiple interactive objects. To tackle the challenge of inaccurate interactive motion recovery in complex scenes, we propose LiveScene, a scene-level language-embedded interactive radiance field that efficiently reconstructs and controls multiple objects. By decomposing the interactive scene into local deformable fields, LiveScene enables separate reconstruction of individual object motions, reducing memory consumption. Additionally, our interaction-aware language embedding localizes individual interactive objects, allowing for arbitrary control using natural language. Our approach demonstrates significant superiority in novel view synthesis, interactive scene control, and language grounding performance through extensive experiments.

Prior work on hypothesis generation can be broadly categorized into theory-driven and data-driven approaches. While both have proven effective in generating novel and plausible hypotheses, it remains an open question whether they can complement each other. To address this, we develop the first method that combines literature-based insights with data to perform LLM-powered hypothesis generation. We apply our method on five different datasets and demonstrate that integrating literature and data outperforms other baselines (8.97% over few-shot, 15.75% over literature-based alone, and 3.37% over data-driven alone). Additionally, we conduct the first human evaluation to assess the utility of LLM-generated hypotheses in assisting human decision-making on two challenging tasks: deception detection and AI generated content detection. Our results show that human accuracy improves significantly by 7.44% and 14.19% on these tasks, respectively. These findings suggest that integrating literature-based and data-driven approaches provides a comprehensive and nuanced framework for hypothesis generation and could open new avenues for scientific inquiry.",2025-07-01,12,ACL
016696f2-ddce-481f-9caa-a5d7087c8abe,Graph Sparsification via Mixture of Graphs,"Guibin Zhang, Xiangguo Sun, Yanwei Yue, Chonghe Jiang, Kun Wang, Tianlong Chen, Shirui Pan","Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated superior performance across various graph learning tasks but face significant computational challenges when applied to large-scale graphs. One effective approach to mitigate these challenges is graph sparsification, which involves removing non-essential edges to reduce computational overhead. However, previous graph sparsification methods often rely on a single global sparsity setting and uniform pruning criteria, failing to provide customized sparsification schemes for each node's complex local context.
In this paper, we introduce Mixture-of-Graphs (MoG), leveraging the concept of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE), to dynamically select tailored pruning solutions for each node. Specifically, MoG incorporates multiple sparsifier experts, each characterized by unique sparsity levels and pruning criteria, and selects the appropriate experts for each node. Subsequently, MoG performs a mixture of the sparse graphs produced by different experts on the Grassmann manifold to derive an optimal sparse graph. One notable property of MoG is its entirely local nature, as it depends on the specific circumstances of each individual node. Extensive experiments on four large-scale OGB datasets and two superpixel datasets, equipped with five GNN backbones, demonstrate that MoG (I) identifies subgraphs at higher sparsity levels ($8.67\\%\sim 50.85\\%$), with performance equal to or better than the dense graph, (II) achieves $1.47-2.62\times$ speedup in GNN inference with negligible performance drop, and (III) boosts ``top-student'' GNN performance ($1.02\\%\uparrow$ on RevGNN+\textsc{ogbn-proteins} and $1.74\\%\\uparrow$ on DeeperGCN+\textsc{ogbg-ppa}).

023c89c0-0a3a-4869-b562-82256070207d,ReGS: Reference-based Controllable Scene Stylization with Gaussian Splatting,"Yiqun Mei, Jiacong Xu, Vishal M. Patel","Referenced-based scene stylization that edits the appearance based on a content-aligned reference image is an emerging research area. Starting with a pretrained neural radiance field (NeRF), existing methods typically learn a novel appearance that matches the given style. Despite their effectiveness, they inherently suffer from time-consuming volume rendering, and thus are impractical for many real-time applications. In this work, we propose ReGS, which adapts 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for reference-based stylization to enable real-time stylized view synthesis. Editing the appearance of a pretrained 3DGS is challenging as it uses discrete Gaussians as 3D representation, which tightly bind appearance with geometry. Simply optimizing the appearance as prior methods do is often insufficient for modeling continuous textures in the given reference image. To address this challenge, we propose a novel texture-guided control mechanism that adaptively adjusts local responsible Gaussians to a new geometric arrangement, serving for desired texture details. The proposed process is guided by texture clues for effective appearance editing, and regularized by scene depth for preserving original geometric structure. With these novel designs, we show ReGs can produce state-of-the-art stylization results that respect the reference texture while embracing real-time rendering speed for free-view navigation.",2024-12-16,8,NeurIPS
027f9c8f-b0ef-42da-ab27-98c55e015190,Online Relational Inference for Evolving Multi-agent Interacting Systems,"Beomseok Kang, Priyabrata Saha, Sudarshan Sharma, Biswadeep Chakraborty, Saibal Mukhopadhyay","We introduce a novel framework, Online Relational Inference (ORI), designed to efficiently identify hidden interaction graphs in evolving multi-agent interacting systems using streaming data. Unlike traditional offline methods that rely on a fixed training set, ORI employs online backpropagation, updating the model with each new data point, thereby allowing it to adapt to changing environments in real-time. A key innovation is the use of an adjacency matrix as a trainable parameter, optimized through a new adaptive learning rate technique called AdaRelation, which adjusts based on the historical sensitivity of the decoder to changes in the interaction graph. Additionally, a data augmentation method named Trajectory Mirror (TM) is introduced to improve generalization by exposing the model to varied trajectory patterns. Experimental results on both synthetic datasets and real-world data (CMU MoCap for human motion) demonstrate that ORI significantly improves the accuracy and adaptability of relational inference in dynamic settings compared to existing methods. This approach is model-agnostic, enabling seamless integration with various neural relational inference (NRI) architectures, and offers a robust solution for real-time applications in complex, evolving systems.",2024-12-16,1,NeurIPS
03128ee3-aaa1-405b-a28a-df562d47a398,A Simple Image Segmentation Framework via In-Context Examples,"Yang Liu, Chenchen Jing, Hengtao Li, Muzhi Zhu, Hao Chen, Xinlong Wang, Chunhua Shen","Recently, there have been explorations of generalist segmentation models that can effectively tackle a variety of image segmentation tasks within a unified in-context learning framework. However, these methods still struggle with task ambiguity in in-context segmentation, as not all in-context examples can accurately convey the task information. In order to address this issue, we present SINE, a simple image $\textbf{S}$egmentation framework utilizing $\textbf{in}$-context $\textbf{e}$xamples. Our approach leverages a Transformer encoder-decoder structure, where the encoder provides high-quality image representations, and the decoder is designed to yield multiple task-specific output masks to eliminate task ambiguity effectively. Specifically, we introduce an In-context Interaction module to complement in-context information and produce correlations between the target image and the in-context example and a Matching Transformer that uses fixed matching and a Hungarian algorithm to eliminate differences between different tasks. In addition, we have further perfected the current evaluation system for in-context image segmentation, aiming to facilitate a holistic appraisal of these models. Experiments on various segmentation tasks show the effectiveness of the proposed method.",2024-12-16,10,NeurIPS

However, existing models and benchmarks are commonly tailored to specific tasks, falling short of capturing the full complexity of online shopping. Large Language Models (LLMs), with their multi-task and few-shot learning abilities, have the potential to profoundly transform online shopping by alleviating task-specific engineering efforts and by providing users with interactive conversations. Despite the potential, LLMs face unique challenges in online shopping, such as domain-specific concepts, implicit knowledge, and heterogeneous user behaviors. Motivated by the potential and challenges, we propose Shopping MMLU, a diverse multi-task online shopping benchmark derived from real-world Amazon data. Shopping MMLU consists of 57 tasks covering 4 major shopping skills: concept understanding, knowledge reasoning, user behavior alignment, and multi-linguality, and can thus comprehensively evaluate the abilities of LLMs as general shop assistants. With Shoppping MMLU, we benchmark over 20 existing LLMs and uncover valuable insights about practices and prospects of building versatile LLM-based shop assistants.

Giese, Rufin Vogels","High-level visual brain regions contain subareas in which neurons appear to respond more strongly to examples of a particular semantic category, like faces or bodies, rather than objects. However, recent work has shown that while this finding holds on average, some out-of-category stimuli also activate neurons in these regions. This may be due to visual features common among the preferred class also being present in other images. Here, we propose a deep-learning-based approach for visualizing these features. For each neuron, we identify relevant visual features driving its selectivity by modelling responses to images based on latent activations of a deep neural network. Given an out-of-category image which strongly activates the neuron, our method first identifies a reference image from the preferred category yielding a similar feature activation pattern. We then backpropagate latent activations of both images to the pixel level, while enhancing the identified shared dimensions and attenuating non-shared features. The procedure highlights image regions containing shared features driving responses of the model neuron. We apply the algorithm to novel recordings from body-selective regions in macaque IT cortex in order to understand why some images of objects excite these neurons. Visualizations reveal object parts which resemble parts of a macaque body, shedding light on neural preference of these objects.",2024-12-16,1,NeurIPS

Linderman","A core aim in theoretical and systems neuroscience is to develop models which help us better understand biological intelligence. Such models range broadly in both complexity and biological plausibility. One widely-adopted example is task-optimized recurrent neural networks (RNNs), which have been used to generate hypotheses about how the brain’s neural dynamics may organize to accomplish tasks. However, task-optimized RNNs typically have a fixed weight matrix representing the synaptic connectivity between neurons. From decades of neuroscience research, we know that synaptic weights are constantly changing, controlled in part by chemicals such as neuromodulators. In this work we explore the computational implications of synaptic gain scaling, a form of neuromodulation, using task-optimized low-rank RNNs.In our neuromodulated RNN (NM-RNN) model, a neuromodulatory subnetwork outputs a low-dimensional neuromodulatory signal that dynamically scales the low-rank recurrent weights of an output-generating RNN. In empirical experiments, we find that the structured flexibility in the NM-RNN allows it to both train and generalize with a higher degree of accuracy than low-rank RNNs on a set of canonical tasks.Additionally, via theoretical analyses we show how neuromodulatory gain scaling endows networks with gating mechanisms commonly found in artificial RNNs. We end by analyzing the low-rank dynamics of trained NM-RNNs, to show how task computations are distributed.",2024-12-16,7,NeurIPS

However, we empirically find that this workflow often fails to accurately depict theout-of-distributionconcepts. This failure is highly related to the low quality of training data. To resolve this, we present a framework called Controllable Adaptor Towards Out-of-Distribution Concepts (CATOD). Our framework follows the active learning paradigm which includes high-quality data accumulation and adaptor training, enabling a finer-grained enhancement of generative results. Theaestheticsscore andconcept-matchingscore are two major factors that impact the quality of synthetic results. One key component of CATOD is the weighted scoring system that automatically balances between these two scores and we also offer comprehensive theoretical analysis for this point. Then, it determines how to select data and schedule the adaptor training based on this scoring system. The extensive results show that CATOD significantly outperforms the prior approaches with an 11.10 boost on the CLIP score and a 33.08% decrease on the CMMD metric.",2024-12-16,1,NeurIPS

				146-154","Advances in robotic control and sensing have propelled the rise of automated scientific laboratories capable of high-throughput experiments. However, automated scientific laboratories are currently limited by human intuition in their ability to efficiently design and interpret experiments in high-dimensional spaces, throttling scientific discovery. We present AutoSciLab, a machine learning framework for driving autonomous scientific experiments, forming a surrogate researcher purposed for scientific discovery in high-dimensional spaces. AutoSciLab autonomously follows the scientific method in four steps: (i) generating high-dimensional experiments (x) using a variational autoencoder (ii) selecting optimal experiments by forming hypotheses using active learning (iii) distilling the experimental results to discover relevant low-dimensional latent variables (z) with a ‘directional autoencoder’ and (iv) learning a human interpretable equation connecting the discovered latent variables with a quantity of interest (y = f (z)), using a neural network equation learner. We validate the generalizability of AutoSciLab by rediscovering a) the principles of projectile motion and b) the phase-transitions within the spin-states of the Ising model (NP-hard problem).

				1031-1039","The questionable responses caused by knowledge hallucination may lead to LLMs' unstable ability in decision-making. However, it has never been investigated whether the LLMs' hallucination is possibly usable for generating negative reasoning to assist fake news detection.

Upon that, we construct a negative reasoning-based news learning model called - NRFE, which leverages positive or negative news-reasoning pairs for learning the semantic consistency between them. To avoid the impact of label-implicated reasoning, we deploy a student model - NRFE-D that only takes news content as input to inspect the performance of our method by distilling the knowledge from NRFE.

While effective, the existing VICL paradigm exhibits poor generalizability under distribution shifts. In this work, we propose test-time Visual In-Context Tuning (VICT), a method that can adapt VICL models on the fly with a single test sample. Specifically, we flip the role between the task prompts and the test sample and use a cycle consistency loss to reconstruct the original task prompt output.

We propose a generic method for a wide class of optimization problems that ask to select a feasible subset of input items of minimal (or maximal) total weight. This gives simple (near-)linear-time algorithms for, e.g., Vertex Cover, Steiner Tree, Minimum Weight Perfect Matching, Knapsack, and Maximum Clique. Our algorithms produce an optimal solution when provided with perfect predictions and their approximation ratio smoothly degrades with increasing prediction error. With small enough prediction error we achieve approximation guarantees that are beyond the reach without predictions in given time bounds, as exemplified by the NP-hardness and APX-hardness of many of the above problems. Although we show our approach to be optimal for this class of problems as a whole, there is a potential for exploiting specific structural properties of individual problems to obtain improved bounds; we demonstrate this on the Steiner Tree problem. We conclude with an empirical evaluation of our approach.",2024-10-04,2,ICLR

However, video models are not grounded in the embodiment of an agent, and do not describe how to actuate the world to reach the visual states depicted in a video.
To tackle this problem, current methods use a separate vision-based inverse dynamic model trained on embodiment-specific data to map image states to actions. 
Gathering data to train such a model is often expensive and challenging, and this model is limited to visual settings similar to the ones in which data is available.
In this paper, we investigate how to directly  ground video models to continuous actions through self-exploration in the embodied environment -- using generated video states as visual goals for exploration.
We propose a framework that uses trajectory level action generation in combination with video guidance to
enable an agent to solve complex tasks without any external supervision, e.g., rewards, action labels, or segmentation masks.
We validate the proposed approach on 8 tasks in Libero, 6 tasks in MetaWorld, 4 tasks in Calvin, and 12 tasks in iThor Visual Navigation.

In this paper, we argue that these methods ignore the limitation of the sparse skeleton 2D input representation, which fundamentally restricts the 2D-to-3D lifting and worsens the occlusion issue. To address these, we propose a novel two-stage generative densification method, named Hierarchical Pose AutoRegressive Transformer (HiPART), to generate hierarchical 2D dense poses from the original sparse 2D pose. Specifically, we first develop a multi-scale skeleton tokenization module to quantize the highly dense 2D pose into hierarchical tokens and propose a Skeleton-aware Alignment to strengthen token connections. We then develop a Hierarchical AutoRegressive Modeling scheme for hierarchical 2D pose generation. With generated hierarchical poses as inputs for 2D-to-3D lifting, the proposed method shows strong robustness in occluded scenarios and achieves state-of-the-art performance on the single-frame-based 3D HPE. Moreover, it outperforms numerous multi-frame methods while reducing parameter and computational complexity and can also complement them to further enhance performance and robustness.",2025-06-01,3,CVPR

However, data heterogeneity resulting from differences across user behaviors, preferences, and device characteristics poses a significant challenge for federated learning. Most previous works overlook the adjustment of aggregation weights, relying solely on dataset size for weight assignment, which often leads to unstable convergence and reduced model performance. Recently, several studies have sought to refine aggregation strategies by incorporating dataset characteristics and model alignment. However, adaptively adjusting aggregation weights while ensuring data security-without requiring additional proxy data-remains a significant challenge. In this work, we propose Federated learning with Adaptive Weight Aggregation (FedAWA), a novel method that adaptively adjusts aggregation weights based on client vectors during the learning process. The client vector captures the direction of model updates, reflecting local data variations, and is used to optimize the aggregation weight without requiring additional datasets or violating privacy. By assigning higher aggregation weights to local models whose updates align closely with the global optimization direction, FedAWA enhances the stability and generalization of the global model.

Here, the main bottleneck is data acquisition for training: collecting a large-scale dataset of high-quality reference garment images per human subject is quite challenging, i.e., ideally, one needs to manually gather every single garment photograph worn by each human. To address this, we propose a data generation pipeline to construct a large synthetic dataset, consisting of human and multiple-garment pairs, by introducing a model to extract any reference garment images from each human image. To ensure data quality, we also propose a filtering strategy to remove undesirable generated data based on measuring perceptual similarities between the garment presented in human image and extracted garment. Finally, by utilizing the constructed synthetic dataset, we train a diffusion model having two parallel denoising paths that use multiple garment images as conditions to generate human images while preserving their fine-grained details.

Specifically, we formulate 3DGS optimization as progressively fitting 3DGS to higher levels of frequency components in the training views, and propose a dynamic rendering resolution scheme that largely reduces the optimization complexity based on this formulation. Besides, we argue that a specific rendering resolution should cooperate with a proper primitive number for a better balance between computing redundancy and fitting quality, where we schedule the growth of the primitives to synchronize with the rendering resolution.

In this work, we perform a comparative study of score-based diffusion models for forecasting and assimilation of sparse observations.  In particular, we focus on diffusion models that are either trained in a conditional manner, or conditioned after unconditional training. We address the shortcomings of existing models by proposing 1) an autoregressive sampling approach, that significantly improves performance in forecasting, 2) a new training strategy for conditional score-based models that achieves stable performance over a range of history lengths, and 3) a hybrid model which employs flexible pre-training conditioning on initial conditions and flexible post-training conditioning to handle data assimilation.

However, these studies still fail to overcome the following challenges: (1) insufficiently utilizing the historical temporal information among inter-steps, (2) overlooking the local intra-step relationships among return-to-gos (RTGs), states, and actions, (3) overfitting suboptimal trajectories with noisy labels.

Finally, to mitigate the overfitting issue on noisy trajectories, a self-evolving policy is proposed by using progressive regularization.

Despite impressive image quality, these models have various prompt compliance problems, including low recall in generating multiple objects, difficulty in generating text in images, and meeting constraints like object locations and pose. For fine-grained editing and manipulation, they also require fine-grained semantic or instance maps that are tedious to produce manually. While prompt compliance can be enhanced by addition of loss functions at inference, this is time consuming and does not scale to complex scenes.   To overcome these limitations, this work introduces a new family of  $\textit{Factor Graph Diffusion Models}$ (FG-DMs) that models the joint distribution of images and conditioning variables, such as semantic, sketch, depth or normal maps via a factor graph decomposition. This joint structure has several advantages, including support for efficient sampling based prompt compliance schemes, which produce images of high object recall, semi-automated fine-grained editing, explainability at intermediate levels, ability to produce labeled datasets for the training of downstream models such as segmentation or depth, training with missing data, and continual learning where new conditioning variables can be added with minimal or no modifications to the existing structure. We propose an implementation of FG-DMs by adapting a pre-trained Stable Diffusion (SD) model to implement all FG-DM factors, using only COCO dataset, and show that it is effective in generating images with 15\% higher recall than SD while retaining its generalization ability. We introduce an attention distillation loss that encourages consistency among the attention maps of all factors, improving the fidelity of the generated conditions and image.

To maintain the generation capability of diffusion models after concept erasure, it is necessary to remove only the image region containing the target concept when it locally appears in an image, leaving other regions intact. However, prior arts often compromise fidelity of the other image regions in order to erase the localized target concept appearing in a specific area, thereby reducing the overall performance of image generation. To address these limitations, we first introduce a framework called localized concept erasure, which allows for the deletion of only the specific area containing the target concept in the image while preserving the other regions. As a solution for the localized concept erasure, we propose a training-free approach, dubbed Gated Low-rank adaptation for Concept Erasure (GLoCE), that injects a lightweight module into the diffusion model. GLoCE consists of low-rank matrices and a simple gate, determined only by several generation steps for concepts without training. By directly applying GLoCE to image embeddings and designing the gate to activate only for target concepts, GLoCE can selectively remove only the region of the target concepts, even when target and remaining concepts coexist within an image. Extensive experiments demonstrated GLoCE not only improves the image fidelity to text prompts after erasing the localized target concepts, but also outperforms prior arts in efficacy, specificity, and robustness by large margin and can be extended to mass concept erasure.",2025-06-01,4,CVPR

Then, we analyze values through the lens of five theoretical frameworks inspired by sociology, psychology, and philosophy, including the World Values Survey, Moral Foundations Theory, Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs, Aristotle's Virtues, and Plutchik's Wheel of Emotions. For instance, we find LLMs are most aligned with self-expression over survival in World Values Survey and care over loyalty in Moral Foundations Theory. Interestingly, we find substantial preference differences in models for some core values. For example, for truthfulness, Mixtral-8x7B neglects it by 9.7% while GPT-4-turbo selects it by 9.4%.

Existing methods grounded on the information bottleneck principle compute information in a specific layer to obtain attributions, compressing the features by injecting noise via a parametric damping ratio. However, the attribution obtained in a specific layer neglects evidence of the decision-making process distributed across layers. In this paper, we introduce a comprehensive information bottleneck (CoIBA), which discovers the relevant information in each targeted layer to explain the decision-making process. Our core idea is applying information bottleneck in multiple targeted layers to estimate the comprehensive information by sharing a parametric damping ratio across the layers. Leveraging this shared ratio complements the over-compressed information to discover the omitted clues of the decision by sharing the relevant information across the targeted layers. We suggest the variational approach to fairly reflect the relevant information of each layer by upper bounding layer-wise information.

Can they do this solely through interactions with each other? We focus this question on the ability of agents to attain the value of their Stackelberg optimal strategy and study the impact of information asymmetry. We study repeated interactions in fully strategic environments where players' actions are decided based on learning algorithms that take into account their observed histories and knowledge of the game. We study the pure Nash equilibria (PNE) of a meta-game where players choose these algorithms as their actions. We demonstrate that if one player has perfect knowledge about the game, then any initial informational gap persists. That is, while there is always a PNE in which the informed agent achieves her Stackelberg value, there is a game where no PNE of the meta-game allows the partially informed player to achieve her Stackelberg value. On the other hand, if both players start with some uncertainty about the game, the quality of information alone does not determine which agent can achieve her Stackelberg value. In this case, the concept of information asymmetry becomes nuanced and depends on the game's structure. Overall, our findings suggest that repeated strategic interactions alone cannot facilitate learning effectively enough to earn an uninformed player her Stackelberg value.",2024-12-16,5,NeurIPS

As the computational cost of transformers increases with the number of patches in each image, we propose to randomly mask up to 75% of the image patches during training. We propose a deferred masking strategy that preprocesses all patches using a patch-mixer before masking, thus significantly reducing the performance degradation with masking, making it superior to model downscaling in reducing computational cost.

To bridge this gap, we introduce PPD, a multi-reward optimization objective that aligns diffusion models with personalized preferences. With PPD, a diffusion model learns the individual preferences of a population of users in a few-shot way, enabling generalization to unseen users.

Conditioning on user embeddings, the text-to-image models are fine-tuned with the DPO objective, simultaneously optimizing for alignment with the preferences of multiple users. Empirical results demonstrate that our method effectively optimizes for multiple reward functions and can interpolate between them during inference.

The key insight behind FiRe is that smooth images emerge as fixed points of the composition of a degradation operator with the corresponding restoration model. This enables us to derive an explicit formula for our implicit prior by quantifying invariance of images under this composite operation. Adopting this fixed-point perspective, we show how various restoration networks can effectively serve as priors for solving inverse problems. The FiRe framework further enables ensemble-like combinations of multiple restoration models as well as acquisition-informed restoration networks, all within a unified optimization approach.

We propose a novel motion prediction conditional flow matching model, termed MoFlow, to predict K-shot future trajectories for all agents in a given scene. We design a novel flow matching loss function that not only ensures at least one of the $K$ sets of future trajectories is accurate but also encourages all $K$ sets of future trajectories to be diverse and plausible. Furthermore, by leveraging the implicit maximum likelihood estimation (IMLE), we propose a novel distillation method for flow models that only requires samples from the teacher model. Extensive experiments on the real-world datasets, including SportVU NBA games, ETH-UCY, and SDD, demonstrate that both our teacher flow model and the IMLE-distilled student model achieve state-of-the-art performance. These models can generate diverse trajectories that are physically and socially plausible. Moreover, our one-step student model is $\textbf{100}$ times faster than the teacher flow model during sampling.

Although recent studies have developed various generative models for graphic design, they usually face the following limitations: they only focus on certain subtasks and are far from achieving the design composition task; they do not consider the hierarchical information of graphic designs during the generation process. To tackle these issues, we introduce the layered design principle into Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) and propose a novel approach, called LaDeCo, to accomplish this challenging task. Specifically, LaDeCo first performs layer planning for a given element set, dividing the input elements into different semantic layers according to their contents. Based on the planning results, it subsequently predicts element attributes that control the design composition in a layer-wise manner, and includes the rendered image of previously generated layers into the context. With this insightful design, LaDeCo decomposes the difficult task into smaller manageable steps, making the generation process smoother and clearer. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of LaDeCo in design composition. Furthermore, we show that LaDeCo enables some interesting applications in graphic design, such as resolution adjustment, element filling, design variation, etc. In addition, it even outperforms the specialized models in some design subtasks without any task-specific training.",2025-06-01,1,CVPR

Ilgen, Emma Pierson, Pang Wei Koh, Yulia Tsvetkov","Users typically engage with LLMs interactively, yet most existing benchmarks evaluate them in a static, single-turn format, posing reliability concerns in interactive scenarios. We identify a key obstacle towards reliability: LLMs are trained to answer any question, even with incomplete context or insufficient knowledge. In this paper, we propose to change the static paradigm to an interactive one, develop systems that proactively ask questions to gather more information and respond reliably, and introduce an benchmark—MEDIQ—to evaluate question-asking ability in LLMs. MEDIQ simulates clinical interactions consisting of a Patient System and an adaptive Expert System; with potentially incomplete initial information, the Expert refrains from making diagnostic decisions when unconfident, and instead elicits missing details via follow-up questions. We provide a pipeline to convert single-turn medical benchmarks into an interactive format. Our results show that directly prompting state-of-the-art LLMs to ask questions degrades performance, indicating that adapting LLMs to proactive information-seeking settings is nontrivial. We experiment with abstention strategies to better estimate model confidence and decide when to ask questions, improving diagnostic accuracy by 22.3%; however, performance still lags compared to an (unrealistic in practice) upper bound with complete information upfront. Further analyses show improved interactive performance with filtering irrelevant contexts and reformatting conversations. Overall, we introduce a novel problem towards LLM reliability, an interactive MEDIQ benchmark and a novel question-asking system, and highlight directions to extend LLMs’ information-seeking abilities in critical domains.",2024-12-16,55,NeurIPS

This versatility eliminates the need for patching and allows efficient processing of diverse geometries. The sequential nature of our latent representation can be interpreted spatially and permits the use of a conditional transformer for modeling the temporal dynamics of PDEs.

Even though scene flow has wide potential use, it is not used in practice because current predictive models do not generalize well. We identify three key challenges and propose solutions for each. First, we create a method that jointly estimates geometry and motion for accurate prediction. Second, we alleviate scene flow data scarcity with a data recipe that affords us 1M annotated training samples across diverse synthetic scenes. Third, we evaluate different parameterizations for scene flow prediction and adopt a natural and effective parameterization. Our resulting model outperforms existing methods as well as baselines built on large-scale models in terms of 3D end-point error, and shows zero-shot generalization to the casually captured videos from DAVIS and the robotic manipulation scenes from RoboTAP.

Popular sampling methods like top-p (nucleus sampling) often struggle to balance quality and diversity, especially at higher temperatures which lead to incoherent or repetitive outputs. We propose min-p sampling, a dynamic truncation method that adjusts the sampling threshold based on the model's confidence by using the top token's probability as a scaling factor. Our experiments on benchmarks including GPQA, GSM8K, and AlpacaEval Creative Writing show that min-p sampling improves both the quality and diversity of generated text across different model families (Mistral and Llama 3) and model sizes (1B to 123B parameters), especially at higher temperatures. Human evaluations further show a clear preference for min-p sampling, in both text quality and creativity.

We formulate finding the optimal decomposition policy for optimal verification as a bilevel optimization problem. To approximate a solution for this strongly NP-hard problem, we propose dynamic decomposition, a reinforcement learning framework that leverages verifier feedback to learn a policy for dynamically decomposing claims to verifier-preferred atomicity. Experimental results show that dynamic decomposition outperforms existing decomposition policies, improving verification confidence by 0.07 and accuracy by 0.12 (on a 0-1 scale) on average across varying verifiers, datasets, and atomcities of input claims.",2025-07-01,2,ACL

However, these approaches tend to generate blurrier results than their image counterparts as they are limited in their generative capability. This raises a fundamental question: can we extend the success of a generative image upsampler to the VSR task while preserving the temporal consistency? We introduce VideoGigaGAN, a new generative VSR model that can produce videos with high-frequency details and temporal consistency. VideoGigaGAN builds upon a large-scale image upsampler -- GigaGAN. Simply inflating GigaGAN to a video model by adding temporal modules produces severe temporal flickering. We identify several key issues and propose techniques that significantly improve the temporal consistency of upsampled videos. Our experiments show that, unlike previous VSR methods, VideoGigaGAN generates temporally consistent videos with more fine-grained appearance details.

However, these methods typically rely on a single VLM to align the feature spaces of 3D models within a common language space, which limits the potential of 3D models to leverage the diverse spatial and semantic capabilities encapsulated in various foundation models. In this paper, we propose Cross-modal and Uncertainty-aware Agglomeration for Open-vocabulary 3D Scene Understanding dubbed CUA-O3D, the first model to integrate multiple foundation models-such as CLIP, DINOv2, and Stable Diffusion-into 3D scene understanding. We further introduce a deterministic uncertainty estimation to adaptively distill and harmonize the heterogeneous 2D feature embeddings from these models. Our method addresses two key challenges: (1) incorporating semantic priors from VLMs alongside the geometric knowledge of spatially-aware vision foundation models, and (2) using a novel deterministic uncertainty estimation to capture model-specific uncertainties across diverse semantic and geometric sensitivities, helping to reconcile heterogeneous representations during training. Extensive experiments on ScanNetV2 and Matterport3D demonstrate that our method not only advances open-vocabulary segmentation but also achieves robust cross-domain alignment and competitive spatial perception capabilities.

Firstly, we explore a data augmentation technique well-suited for the crowd counting task. By inpainting the background regions, this technique can effectively enhance data diversity while preserving the fidelity of the entire scenes. Secondly, we introduce the Visual State Space Model as backbone to capture the global context information from crowd scenes, which is crucial for extremely crowded, low-light, and adverse weather scenarios. In addition to the traditional regression head for exact prediction, we employ an Anti-Noise classification head to provide less exact but more accurate supervision, since the regression head is sensitive to noise in manual annotations.

We take the 3D planes as the main objective due to their compactness and structural expressiveness in indoor scenes, and develop an explicit optimization framework that learns to fit the expected surface of indoor scenes by splatting the 3D planes into 2.5D depth and normal maps. As our PlanarSplatting operates directly on the 3D plane primitives, it eliminates the dependencies on 2D/3D plane detection and plane matching and tracking for planar surface reconstruction. Furthermore, the essential merits of plane-based representation plus CUDA-based implementation of planar splatting functions, PlanarSplatting reconstructs an indoor scene in 3 minutes while having significantly better geometric accuracy.

Recently, diffusion denoising bridge models (DDBMs), a new formulation of generative modeling that builds stochastic processes between fixed data endpoints based on a reference diffusion process, have achieved empirical success across tasks with coupled data distribution, such as image-to-image translation. However, DDBM's sampling process typically requires hundreds of network evaluations to achieve decent performance, which may impede their practical deployment due to high computational demands. In this work, inspired by the recent advance of consistency models in DMs, we tackle this problem by learning the consistency function of the probability-flow ordinary differential equation (PF-ODE) of DDBMs, which directly predicts the solution at a starting step given any point on the ODE trajectory. Based on a dedicated general-form ODE solver, we propose two paradigms: consistency bridge distillation and consistency bridge training, which is flexible to apply on DDBMs with broad design choices. Experimental results show that our proposed method could sample $4\times$ to $50\times$ faster than the base DDBM and produce better visual quality given the same step in various tasks with pixel resolution ranging from $64 \times 64$ to $256 \times 256$, as well as supporting downstream tasks such as semantic interpolation in the data space.",2024-12-16,11,NeurIPS

Barron, Jia-Bin Huang, Pratul P. Srinivasan, Dor Verbin","Reconstructing the geometry and appearance of objects from photographs taken in different environments is difficult as the illumination and therefore the object appearance vary across captured images. This is particularly challenging for more specular objects whose appearance strongly depends on the viewing direction. Some prior approaches model appearance variation across images using a per-image embedding vector, while others use physically-based rendering to recover the materials and per-image illumination. Such approaches fail at faithfully recovering view-dependent appearance given significant variation in input illumination and tend to produce mostly diffuse results. We present an approach that reconstructs objects from images taken under different illuminations by first relighting the images under a single reference illumination with a multiview relighting diffusion model and then reconstructing the object's geometry and appearance with a radiance field architecture that is robust to the small remaining inconsistencies among the relit images. We validate our proposed approach on both synthetic and real datasets and demonstrate that it greatly outperforms existing techniques at reconstructing high-fidelity appearance from images taken under extreme illumination variation.

INCLINE initially learns alignment matrices using parallel sentences from source and target languages through a Least-Squares optimization, and then applies these matrices during inference to transform the low-performing language representations toward the high-performing language space. Extensive experiments on nine benchmarks with five LLMs demonstrate that INCLINE significantly improves performance across diverse tasks and languages, compared to recent strong baselines.

The insight behind HiMoR is that motions in everyday scenes can be decomposed into coarser motions that serve as the foundation for finer details. Using a tree structure, HiMoR's nodes represent different levels of motion detail, with shallower nodes modeling coarse motion for temporal smoothness and deeper nodes capturing finer motion. Additionally, our model uses a few shared motion bases to represent motions of different sets of nodes, aligning with the assumption that motion tends to be smooth and simple. This motion representation design provides Gaussians with a more structured deformation, maximizing the use of temporal relationships to tackle the challenging task of monocular dynamic 3D reconstruction. We also propose using a more reliable perceptual metric as an alternative, given that pixel-level metrics for evaluating monocular dynamic 3D reconstruction can sometimes fail to accurately reflect the true quality of reconstruction.

Their performances largely depend on the prompt quality. While recent methods show that visual descriptions generated by large language models (LLMs) enhance the generalization of VLMs, class-specific prompts may be inaccurate or lack discrimination due to the hallucination in LLMs. In this paper, we aim to find visually discriminative prompts for fine-grained categories with minimal supervision and no human-in-the-loop. An evolution-based algorithm is proposed to progressively optimize language prompts from task-specific templates to class-specific descriptions. Unlike optimizing templates, the search space shows an explosion in class-specific candidate prompts. This increases prompt generation costs, iterative times, and the overfitting problem. To this end, we first introduce several simple yet effective edit-based and evolution-based operations to generate diverse candidate prompts by one-time query of LLMs. Then, two sampling strategies are proposed to find a better initial search point and reduce traversed categories, saving iteration costs. Moreover, we apply a novel fitness score with entropy constraints to mitigate overfitting.

To address this issue, previous methods attempt to reduce the differences between viewpoints by critical attributes and decoupling the viewpoints. While these methods can mitigate viewpoint differences to some extent, they still face two main issues: (1) difficulty in handling viewpoint diversity and (2) neglect of the contribution of local features. To effectively address these challenges, we design and implement the Self-Calibrating and Adaptive Prompt (SeCap) method for the AGPReID task.

However, due to the partially-observed nature of real-world applications, solely focusing on the target of interest, so-called endogenous variables, is usually insufficient to guarantee accurate forecasting. Notably, a system is often recorded into multiple variables, where the exogenous variables can provide valuable external information for endogenous variables. Thus, unlike well-established multivariate or univariate forecasting paradigms that either treat all the variables equally or ignore exogenous information, this paper focuses on a more practical setting: time series forecasting with exogenous variables.

With deftly designed embedding layers, TimeXer empowers the canonical Transformer with the ability to reconcile endogenous and exogenous information, where patch-wise self-attention and variate-wise cross-attention are used simultaneously. Moreover, global endogenous tokens are learned to effectively bridge the causal information underlying exogenous series into endogenous temporal patches.

While generating a single high-quality 3D object is now feasible, generating multiple objects with reasonable interactions within a 3D space, a.k.a. compositional 3D generation, presents substantial challenges. This paper introduces CompGS, a novel generative framework that employs 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) for efficient, compositional text-to-3D content generation. To achieve this goal, two core designs are proposed: (1) 3D Gaussians Initialization with 2D compositionality: We transfer the well-established 2D compositionality to initialize the Gaussian parameters on an entity-by-entity basis, ensuring both consistent 3D priors for each entity and reasonable interactions among multiple entities; (2) Dynamic Optimization: We propose a dynamic strategy to optimize 3D Gaussians using Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) loss. CompGS first automatically decomposes 3D Gaussians into distinct entity parts, enabling optimization at both the entity and composition levels. Additionally, CompGS optimizes across objects of varying scales by dynamically adjusting the spatial parameters of each entity, enhancing the generation of fine-grained details, particularly in smaller entities. Qualitative comparisons and quantitative evaluations on T3Bench demonstrate the effectiveness of CompGS in generating compositional 3D objects with superior image quality and semantic alignment over existing methods. CompGS can also be easily extended to controllable 3D editing, facilitating scene generation. We hope CompGS will provide new insights to the compositional 3D generation.

However, pixels covered by the same Gaussian are always shaded in the same color up to a Gaussian falloff scaling factor. Furthermore, the finest geometric detail any individual Gaussian can represent is a simple ellipsoid. These properties of 3DGS greatly limit the expressivity of individual Gaussian primitives. To address these issues, we draw inspiration from texture and alpha mapping in traditional graphics and integrate it with 3DGS. Specifically, we propose a new generalized Gaussian appearance representation that augments each Gaussian with alpha~(A), RGB, or RGBA texture maps to model spatially varying color and opacity across the extent of each Gaussian. As such, each Gaussian can represent a richer set of texture patterns and geometric structures, instead of just a single color and ellipsoid as in naive Gaussian Splatting. Surprisingly, we found that the expressivity of Gaussians can be greatly improved by using alpha-only texture maps, and further augmenting Gaussians with RGB texture maps achieves the highest expressivity. We validate our method on a wide variety of standard benchmark datasets and our own custom captures at both the object and scene levels. We demonstrate image quality improvements over existing methods while using a similar or lower number of Gaussians.",2025-06-01,11,CVPR

However, the popular approach of full parameter sharing often leads to homogeneous policies among agents, potentially limiting the performance benefits that could be derived from policy diversity. To address this critical limitation, we introduce \emph{Kaleidoscope}, a novel adaptive partial parameter sharing scheme that fosters policy heterogeneity while still maintaining high sample efficiency. Specifically, Kaleidoscope maintains one set of common parameters alongside multiple sets of distinct, learnable masks for different agents, dictating the sharing of parameters. It promotes diversity among policy networks by encouraging discrepancy among these masks, without sacrificing the efficiencies of parameter sharing. This design allows Kaleidoscope to dynamically balance high sample efficiency with a broad policy representational capacity, effectively bridging the gap between full parameter sharing and non-parameter sharing across various environments. We further extend Kaleidoscope to critic ensembles in the context of actor-critic algorithms, which could help improve value estimations. Our empirical evaluations across extensive environments, including multi-agent particle environment, multi-agent MuJoCo and StarCraft multi-agent challenge v2, demonstrate the superior performance of Kaleidoscope compared with existing parameter sharing approaches, showcasing its potential for performance enhancement in MARL.

This model allows for incorporating human feedback into online inference and optimization and has been employed in systems for tuning large language models.The problem is fairly understood in toy settings with linear target functions or over finite small domains that limits practical interest.Taking the next step, we consider infinite domains and kernelized rewards. In this setting, selecting a pair of actions is quite challenging and requires balancing exploration and exploitation at two levels: within the pair, and along the iterations of the algorithm.We propose MaxMinLCB, which emulates this trade-off as a zero-sum Stackelberg game and chooses action pairs that are informative and have favorable reward values. MaxMinLCB consistently outperforms algorithms in the literature and satisfies an anytime-valid rate-optimal regret guarantee. This is owed to our novel preference-based confidence sequences for kernelized logistic estimators, which are of independent interest.",2024-12-16,5,NeurIPS

We observe that the pairwise matching paradigms applied to image set matching often result in ambiguous estimation when the selected independent pairs exhibit significant occlusions or extreme viewpoint changes. This challenge primarily stems from the inherent uncertainty in interpreting intricate 3D structures based on limited two-view observations, as the 3D-to-2D projection leads to significant information loss. To address this, we introduce CoMatcher, a deep multi-view matcher to (i) leverage complementary context cues from different views to form a holistic 3D scene understanding and (ii) utilize cross-view projection consistency to infer a reliable global solution. Building on CoMatcher, we develop a groupwise framework that fully exploits cross-view relationships for large-scale matching tasks.

Namboodiri, Benjamin E Lundell","Gaussian Splatting has changed the game for real-time photo-realistic rendering. One of the most popular applications of Gaussian Splatting is to create animatable avatars, known as Gaussian Avatars. Recent works have pushed the boundaries of quality and rendering efficiency but suffer from two main limitations. Either they require expensive multi-camera rigs to produce avatars with free-view rendering, or they can be trained with a single camera but only rendered at high quality from this fixed viewpoint. An ideal model would be trained using a short monocular video or image from available hardware, such as a webcam, and rendered from any view. To this end, we propose GASP: Gaussian Avatars with Synthetic Priors. To overcome the limitations of existing datasets, we exploit the pixel-perfect nature of synthetic data to train a Gaussian Avatar prior. By fitting this prior model to a single photo or video and fine-tuning it, we get a high-quality Gaussian Avatar, which supports 360$^\circ$ rendering. Our prior is only required for fitting, not inference, enabling real-time application. Through our method, we obtain high-quality, animatable Avatars from limited data which can be animated and rendered at 70fps on commercial hardware.

Within diffusion frameworks, guidance techniques have proven effective in enhancing output quality during inference; however, applying these methods to video diffusion models introduces additional complexity of handling computations across entire sequences. To address this, we propose a novel framework called MotionPrompt that guides the video generation process via optical flow. Specifically, we train a discriminator to distinguish optical flow between random pairs of frames from real videos and generated ones. Given that prompts can influence the entire video, we optimize learnable token embeddings during reverse sampling steps by using gradients from a trained discriminator applied to random frame pairs. This approach allows our method to generate visually coherent video sequences that closely reflect natural motion dynamics, without compromising the fidelity of the generated content.

While optimizing prompts on downstream labeled data has proven effective in improving performance, these methods entail labor costs for annotations and are limited by their quality. Additionally, since CLIP is pre-trained on highly imbalanced Web-scale data, it suffers from inherent label bias that leads to suboptimal performance.  To tackle the above challenges, we propose a label-**F**ree p**ro**mpt distribution **l**earning and b**i**as **c**orrection framework, dubbed as **Frolic**, which boosts zero-shot performance without the need for labeled data. Specifically, our Frolic learns distributions over prompt prototypes to capture diverse visual representations and adaptively fuses these with the original CLIP through confidence matching.This fused model is further enhanced by correcting label bias via a label-free logit adjustment. Notably, our method is not only training-free but also circumvents the necessity for hyper-parameter tuning. Extensive experimental results across 16 datasets demonstrate the efficacy of our approach, particularly outperforming the state-of-the-art by an average of $2.6\%$ on 10 datasets with CLIP ViT-B/16 and achieving an average margin of $1.5\%$ on ImageNet and its five distribution shifts with CLIP ViT-B/16.

Our approach involves generating meaningful fused representations using a novel permutation-based canonical correlation objective. We provide a theoretical analysis showing how the learned embeddings approximate those obtained by supervised linear discriminant analysis (LDA).

They are however effective only when operating at the resolution used during training. Inference at a scaled resolution leads to repetitive patterns and structural distortions. Retraining at higher resolutions quickly becomes prohibitive. Thus, methods enabling pre-existing diffusion models to operate at flexible test-time resolutions are highly desirable. Previous works suffer from frequent artifacts and often introduce large latency overheads. We propose two simple modules that combine to solve these issues. We introduce a Frequency Modulation (FM) module that leverages the Fourier domain to improve the global structure consistency, and an Attention Modulation (AM) module which improves the consistency of local texture patterns, a problem largely ignored in prior works. Our method, coined Fam diffusion, can seamlessly integrate into any latent diffusion model and requires no additional training. Extensive qualitative results highlight the effectiveness of our method in addressing structural and local artifacts, while quantitative results show state-of-the-art performance. Also, our method avoids redundant inference tricks for improved consistency such as patch-based or progressive generation, leading to negligible latency overheads.",2025-06-01,3,CVPR

This problem is motivated by the need to improve worst-case performance, which distribution shift can make much more likely. We study low probability estimation in the context of argmax sampling from small transformer language models. We compare two types of methods: importance sampling, which involves searching for inputs giving rise to the rare output, and activation extrapolation, which involves extrapolating a probability distribution fit to the model's logits. We find that importance sampling outperforms activation extrapolation, but both outperform naive sampling. Finally, we explain how minimizing the probability estimate of an undesirable behavior generalizes adversarial training, and argue that new methods for low probability estimation are needed to provide stronger guarantees about worst-case performance.",2024-10-04,3,ICLR

Manning","Previous work on Universal Transformers (UTs) has demonstrated the importance of parameter sharing across layers. By allowing recurrence in depth, UTs have advantages over standard Transformers in learning compositional generalizations, but layer-sharing comes with a practical limitation of parameter-compute ratio: it drastically reduces the parameter count compared to the non-shared model with the same dimensionality. Naively scaling up the layer size to compensate for the loss of parameters makes its computational resource requirements prohibitive. In practice, no previous work has succeeded in proposing a shared-layer Transformer design that is competitive in parameter count-dominated tasks such as language modeling. Here we propose MoEUT (pronounced ""moot""), an effective mixture-of-experts (MoE)-based shared-layer Transformer architecture, which combines several recent advances in MoEs for both feedforward and attention layers of standard Transformers together with novel layer-normalization and grouping schemes that are specific and crucial to UTs.

We propose a \emph{segment auction} where an ad is probabilistically retrieved for each discourse segment (paragraph, section, or entire output) according to its bid and relevance, following the RAG framework, and priced according to competing bids. We show that our auction maximizes logarithmic social welfare, a new notion of welfare that balances allocation efficiency and fairness, and we characterize the associated incentive-compatible pricing rule. These results are extended to multi-ad allocation per segment.

Typically, images are resized to a fixed resolution, such as 224x224, for efficiency during training and inference. However, uniform input size conflicts with real-world scenarios where images naturally vary in resolution. Modifying the preset resolution of a model may severely degrade the performance. In this work, we propose to enhance the model adaptability to resolution variation by optimizing the patch embedding. The proposed method, called Multi-Scale Patch Embedding (MSPE), substitutes the standard patch embedding with multiple variable-sized patch kernels and selects the best parameters for different resolutions, eliminating the need to resize the original image. Our method does not require high-cost training or modifications to other parts, making it easy to apply to most ViT models.

To address this, we introduce RoboPEPP, a method that fuses information about the robot's physical model into the encoder using a masking-based self-supervised embedding-predictive architecture. Specifically, we mask the robot's joints and pre-train an encoder-predictor model to infer the joints' embeddings from surrounding unmasked regions, enhancing the encoder's understanding of the robot's physical model. The pre-trained encoder-predictor pair, along with joint angle and keypoint prediction networks, is then fine-tuned for pose and joint angle estimation.

Specialized models aim to predict defect region heatmaps but face two primary challenges: (1) lack of explainability, failing to provide reasons and analyses for subtle defects, and (2) inability to leverage common sense and logical reasoning, leading to poor generalization. Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) promise better comprehension and reasoning but face their own challenges: (1) difficulty in fine-grained defect localization due to the limitations in capturing tiny details, and (2) constraints in providing pixel-wise outputs necessary for precise heatmap generation.

				21-30","Verifying safety of neural network control systems that use images as input is a difficult problem because, from a given system state, there is no known way to mathematically model what images are possible in the real-world. We build upon recent work that considers a surrogate verification approach,  training a conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) as an image generator in place of the real world. This setup enables set-based formal analysis of the closed-loop system, providing analysis beyond simulation and testing. While existing work is effective on small examples, excessive overapproximation both within a single control period (one-step error) and across multiple periods (multi-step error) limits its scalability. We propose approaches to overcome these errors. First, we address one-step error by composing the system's dynamics along with the cGAN and neural network controller, without losing the dependencies between input states and the control outputs as in the monotonic analysis of the system dynamics. Second, we reduce multi-step error by repeating the single-step composition, essentially unrolling multiple steps of the control loop into a large neural network. We then leverage existing network verification algorithms to compute accurate reachable sets for multiple steps, avoiding the accumulation of abstraction error at each step.We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in terms of both accuracy and scalability using two case studies. On the aircraft taxiing system, the converged reachable set is  175% larger using the prior baseline method compared with our proposed approach. On the emergency braking system, with 24x the number of image output variables from the cGAN, the baseline method fails to prove any states are safe, whereas our improvements enable set-based safety analysis.",2025-04-11,8,AAAI

We introduce the concept of knowledge entropy, which quantifies the range of memory sources the model engages with; high knowledge entropy indicates that the model utilizes a wide range of memory sources, while low knowledge entropy suggests reliance on specific sources with greater certainty. Our analysis reveals a consistent decline in knowledge entropy as pretraining advances. We also find that the decline is closely associated with a reduction in the model's ability to acquire and retain knowledge, leading us to conclude that diminishing knowledge entropy (smaller number of active memory sources) impairs the model's knowledge acquisition and retention capabilities. We find further support for this by demonstrating that increasing the activity of inactive memory sources enhances the model's capacity for knowledge acquisition and retention.",2024-10-04,9,ICLR

In GCD, previous research overlooks scene information or treats it as noise, reducing its impact during model training. However, in this paper, we argue that scene information should be viewed as a strong prior for inferring novel classes. We attribute the misinterpretation of scene information to a key factor: the Ambiguity Challenge inherent in GCD. Specifically, novel objects in base scenes might be wrongly classified into base categories, while base objects in novel scenes might be mistakenly recognized as novel categories. Once the ambiguity challenge is addressed, scene information can reach its full potential, significantly enhancing the performance of GCD models. To more effectively leverage scene information, we propose the Modeling Object-Scene Associations (MOS) framework, which utilizes a simple MLP-based scene-awareness module to enhance GCD performance.

However, adapting these models with limited few-shot data often leads to overfitting, diminishing their performance on new tasks. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel Multi-Modal Representation Learning (MMRL) framework that introduces a shared, learnable, and modality-agnostic representation space. MMRL projects the space tokens to text and image representation tokens, facilitating more effective multi-modal interactions. Unlike previous approaches that solely optimize class token features, MMRL integrates representation tokens at higher layers of the encoders--where dataset-specific features are more prominent--while preserving generalized knowledge in the lower layers. During training, both representation and class features are optimized, with trainable projection layer applied to the representation tokens, whereas the class token projection layer remains frozen to retain pre-trained knowledge. Furthermore, a regularization term is introduced to align the class features and text features with the zero-shot features from the frozen VLM, thereby safeguarding the model's generalization capacity. For inference, a decoupling strategy is employed, wherein both representation and class features are utilized for base classes, while only the class features, which retain more generalized knowledge, are used for new tasks. Extensive experiments across 15 datasets demonstrate that MMRL outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving a balanced trade-off between task-specific adaptation and generalization.

Immutable heterogeneity, where agents have different and fixed perception networks, presents a major challenge due to the semantic gap in exchanged intermediate features without modifying the perception networks. Most existing methods bridge the semantic gap through interpreters. However, they either require training a new interpreter for each new agent type, limiting extensibility, or rely on a two-stage interpretation via an intermediate standardized semantic space, causing cumulative semantic loss. To achieve both extensibility in immutable heterogeneous scenarios and low-loss feature interpretation, we propose PolyInter, a polymorphic feature interpreter. It provides an extension point where new agents integrate by overriding only their specific prompts, which are learnable parameters that guide interpretation, while reusing PolyInter's remaining parameters. By leveraging polymorphism, our design enables a single interpreter to accommodate diverse agents and interpret their features into the ego agent's semantic space. Experiments on the OPV2V dataset demonstrate that PolyInter improves collaborative perception precision by up to 11.1% compared to SOTA interpreters, while comparable results can be achieved by training only 1.4% of PolyInter's parameters when adapting to new agents.

Traditional ITR estimation methods rely on inverse probability weighting (IPW) to address confounding factors and $L_{1}$-penalization for simplicity and interpretability. However, IPW can introduce statistical bias without precise propensity score modeling, while $L_1$-penalization makes the objective non-smooth, leading to computational bias and requiring subgradient methods. In this paper, we propose a unified ITR estimation framework formulated as a constrained, weighted, and smooth convex optimization problem. The optimal ITR can be robustly and effectively computed by projected gradient descent. Our comprehensive theoretical analysis reveals that weights that balance the spectrum of a `weighted design matrix' improve both the optimization and likelihood landscapes, yielding improved computational and statistical estimation guarantees. In particular, this is achieved by distributional covariate balancing weights, which are model-free alternatives to IPW.

Capitalizing on this realization, by implementing an automated and extensive pipeline, we curate a filtered large-scale image dataset containing pairs of images and their corresponding object-removed versions. Using these pairs, we train a diffusion model to inverse the inpainting process, effectively adding objects into images. Unlike other editing datasets, ours features natural target images instead of synthetic ones while ensuring source-target consistency by construction. Additionally, we utilize a large Vision-Language Model to provide detailed descriptions of the removed objects and a Large Language Model to convert these descriptions into diverse, natural-language instructions. Our quantitative and qualitative results show that the trained model surpasses existing models in both object addition and general editing tasks.

				273-281","Cross-modal contrastive pre-training between natural language and other modalities, e.g., vision and audio, has demonstrated astonishing performance and effectiveness across a diverse variety of tasks and domains. In this paper, we investigate whether such natural language supervision can be used for wearable sensor based Human Activity Recognition (HAR), and discover that--surprisingly--it performs substantially worse than standard end-to-end training and self-supervision. We identify the primary causes for this as: sensor heterogeneity and the lack of rich, diverse text descriptions of activities. To mitigate their impact, we also develop  strategies and assess their effectiveness through an extensive experimental evaluation. These strategies lead to significant increases in activity recognition, bringing performance closer to supervised and self-supervised training, while also enabling the recognition of unseen activities and cross modal retrieval of videos. Overall, our work paves the way for better sensor-language learning, ultimately leading to the development of foundational models for HAR using wearables.",2025-04-11,8,AAAI

FloVD leverages optical flow to represent the motions of the camera and moving objects. This approach offers two key benefits. Since optical flow can be directly estimated from videos, our approach allows for the use of arbitrary training videos without ground-truth camera parameters. Moreover, as background optical flow encodes 3D correlation across different viewpoints, our method enables detailed camera control by leveraging the background motion. To synthesize natural object motion while supporting detailed camera control, our framework adopts a two-stage video synthesis pipeline consisting of optical flow generation and flow-conditioned video synthesis. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method over previous approaches in terms of accurate camera control and natural object motion synthesis.",2025-06-01,11,CVPR

Speculative decoding has been proposed as a technique to accelerate autoregressive generation, leveraging a fast draft model to propose candidate tokens, which are then verified in parallel based on their likelihood under the target model. While this approach guarantees to reproduce the target output, it incurs a substantial penalty: many high-quality draft tokens are rejected, even when they represent objectively valid continuations. Indeed, we show that even powerful draft models such as GPT-4o, as well as human text cannot achieve high acceptance rates under the standard verification scheme. This severely limits the speedup potential of current speculative decoding methods, as an early rejection becomes overwhelmingly likely when solely relying on alignment of draft and target.
We thus ask the following question: Can we adapt verification to recognize correct, but non-aligned replies? To this end, we draw inspiration from the LLM-as-a-judge framework, which demonstrated that LLMs are able to rate answers in a versatile way. We carefully design a dataset coined TokenCourt to elicit the same capability in the target model by training a compact module on top of the embeddings to produce ``judgements"" of the current continuation. We showcase our strategy on the Llama-3.1 family, where our 8B/405B-Judge achieves a speedup of $9\times$ over Llama-405B, while maintaining its quality on a large range of benchmarks. These benefits remain present even in optimized inference frameworks, where our method reaches up to $141$ tokens/s for 8B/70B-Judge and $129$ tokens/s for 8B/405B on $2$ and $8$ H100s respectively.",2024-10-04,21,ICLR

As an instantiation of the paradigm to LoRA, our proposed VB-LoRA composites all the low-rank matrices of LoRA from a shared vector bank with a differentiable top-$k$ admixture module.

In contrast, hyperbolic representation learning, renowned for its ability to model hierarchical and complex relationships between events, has the potential to amplify the discrimination between visually similar events. Inspired by these, we develop a novel Dual-Space Representation Learning (DSRL) method for weakly supervised VVD to utilize the strength of both Euclidean and hyperbolic geometries, capturing the visual features of events while also exploring the intrinsic relations between events, thereby enhancing the discriminative capacity of the features. DSRL employs a novel information aggregation strategy to progressively learn event context in hyperbolic spaces, which selects aggregation nodes through layer-sensitive hyperbolic association degrees constrained by hyperbolic Dirichlet energy. Furthermore, DSRL attempts to break the cyber-balkanization of different spaces, utilizing cross-space attention to facilitate information interactions between Euclidean and hyperbolic space to capture better discriminative features for final violence detection.

MoSim achieves state-of-the-art performance in physical state prediction and provides competitive performance across a range of downstream tasks. This works shows that when a world model is accurate enough and performs precise long-horizon predictions, it can facilitate efficient skill acquisition in imagined worlds and even enable zero-shot reinforcement learning. Furthermore, MoSim can transform any model-free reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm into a model-based approach, effectively decoupling physical environment modeling from RL algorithm development.

However, detecting LGTs is challenging due to the vast number of LLMs, making it impractical to account for each LLM individually; hence, it is crucial to identify the common characteristics shared by these models. In this paper, we draw attention to a common feature of recent powerful LLMs, namely the alignment training, i.e., training LLMs to generate human-preferable texts. Our key finding is that as these aligned LLMs are trained to maximize the human preferences, they generate texts with higher estimated preferences even than human-written texts; thus, such texts are easily detected by using the reward model (i.e., an LLM trained to model human preference distribution). Based on this finding, we propose two training schemes to further improve the detection ability of the reward model, namely (i) continual preference fine-tuning to make reward model prefer aligned LGTs even further and (ii) reward modeling of Human/LLM mixed texts (a rephrased texts from human-written texts using aligned LLMs), which serves as a median preference text corpus between LGTs and human-written texts to learn the decision boundary better.

PETRA facilitates effective model parallelism by enabling stages (i.e., a set of layers) to compute independently on different devices, while only needing to communicate activations and gradients between each other. By decoupling the forward and backward passes and keeping a single updated version of the parameters, the need for weight stashing is also removed.

CFG combines the conditional score (e.g., text-conditioned) with the unconditional score to control the output. However, the unconditional score is in charge of estimating the transition between manifolds of adjacent timesteps from $x_t$ to $x_{t-1}$, which may inadvertently interfere with the trajectory toward the specific condition. In this work, we introduce a novel approach that leverages a geometric perspective on the unconditional score to enhance CFG performance when conditional scores are available. Specifically, we propose a method that filters the singular vectors of both conditional and unconditional scores using singular value decomposition. This filtering process aligns the unconditional score with the conditional score, thereby refining the sampling trajectory to stay closer to the manifold.

In this paper, we leverage Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization (HT-SR) Theory, in particular the shape of empirical spectral densities (ESDs) of weight matrices, to design improved layerwise pruning ratios for LLMs. Our analysis reveals a wide variability in how well-trained, and thus relatedly how prunable, different layers of an LLM are. Based on this, we propose AlphaPruning, which uses shape metrics to allocate layerwise sparsity ratios in a more theoretically-principled manner. AlphaPruning can be used in conjunction with multiple existing LLM pruning methods.

To achieve this, taking aside the non-scalable costly human annotators, we find using GPT4V to caption video with a naive multi-frame or frame-concatenation input strategy leads to less detailed and sometimes temporal-confused results. We argue the challenge of designing a high-quality video captioning strategy lies in three aspects: 1) Inter-frame precise temporal change understanding. 2) Intra-frame detailed content description. 3) Frame-number scalability for arbitrary-length videos.

Specifically, the new frame is matched with the closest keyframe in the maintained Point-Frame Graph (PFG) via the semi-dense based Geometric Initialization Module (GIM). Then the initialized PFG is processed by a proposed Geometric Mamba Module (GMM), which exploits the matching features to refine the overall inter-frame matching.

To alleviate this limitation, we introduce Siamese-Diffusion, a novel dual-component model comprising Mask-Diffusion and Image-Diffusion. During training, a Noise Consistency Loss is introduced between these components to enhance the morphological fidelity of Mask-Diffusion in the parameter space. During sampling, only Mask-Diffusion is used, ensuring diversity and scalability. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method. Siamese-Diffusion boosts SANet's mDice and mIoU by 3.6% and 4.4% on the Polyps, while UNet improves by 1.52% and 1.64% on the ISIC2018. Code is available at GitHub.",2025-06-01,10,CVPR

Using an efficient triplane-based architecture, our method enables semantic-aware texture transfer to a novel target mesh.

However, video understanding remains a challenge despite the availability of substantial web video-text data. This difficulty primarily arises from the inherent complexity of videos and the inefficient language supervision in recent web-collected video-text datasets. In this paper, we introduce Text-Only Pre-Alignment (TOPA), a novel approach to extend large language models (LLMs) for video understanding, without the need for pre-training on real video data. Specifically, we first employ an advanced LLM to automatically generate Textual Videos comprising continuous textual frames, along with corresponding annotations to simulate real video-text data. Then, these annotated textual videos are used to pre-align a language-only LLM with the video modality. To bridge the gap between textual and real videos, we employ the CLIP model as the feature extractor to align image and text modalities. During text-only pre-alignment, the continuous textual frames, encoded as a sequence of CLIP text features, are analogous to continuous CLIP image features, thus aligning the LLM with real video representation. Extensive experiments, including zero-shot evaluation and finetuning on various video understanding tasks, demonstrate that TOPA is an effective and efficient framework for aligning video content with LLMs. In particular, without training on any video data, the TOPA-Llama2-13B model achieves a Top-1 accuracy of 51.0% on the challenging long-form video understanding benchmark, Egoschema. This performance surpasses previous video-text pre-training approaches and proves competitive with recent GPT-3.5 based video agents.",2024-12-16,6,NeurIPS

Existing methods are, however, either sub-optimal solvers or pursuing global optimality at a significant cost of computing time. In contrast to prior works, we introduce convex relaxation techniques to solve this task for the first time. Specifically, we employ a ""soft"" association scheme, realized via a truncated multi-selection error, that allows for joint estimation of VPs' locations and line-VP associations. This approach leads to a primal problem that can be reformulated into a quadratically constrained quadratic programming (QCQP) problem, which is then relaxed into a convex semidefinite programming (SDP) problem. To solve this SDP problem efficiently, we present a globally optimal outlier-robust iterative solver (called GlobustVP), which independently searches for one VP and its associated lines in each iteration, treating other lines as outliers. After each independent update of all VPs, the mutual orthogonality between the three VPs in a Manhattan world is reinforced via local refinement. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world data demonstrate that GlobustVP achieves a favorable balance between efficiency, robustness, and global optimality compared to previous works.

In this paper we introduce Frugal Flows, a likelihood-based machine learning model that uses normalising flows to flexibly learn the data-generating process, while also directly targeting the marginal causal quantities inferred from observational data. We provide a novel algorithm for fitting a model to observational data with a parametrically specified causal distribution, and propose that these models are exceptionally well suited for synthetic data generation to validate causal methods. Unlike existing data generation methods, Frugal Flows generate synthetic data that closely resembles the empirical dataset, while also automatically and exactly satisfying a user-defined average treatment effect. To our knowledge, Frugal Flows are the first generative model to both learn flexible data representations and also \textit{exactly} parameterise quantities such as the average treatment effect and the degree of unobserved confounding.

				631-639","Most existing semi-supervised community detection algorithms leverage known communities to learn community structures, subsequently identifying communities that align with these learned community structures. However, differences in community structures may render the community structures learned by these methods inappropriate for the community containing the given node of interest. As a result, the identified community may exclude the given node or be of poor quality. Inspired by the success of reinforcement learning, we propose a Semi-supervised Local community detection method based on Reinforcement Learning, named SLRL, which only explores parts of the network surrounding the given node.  It first extracts the local structure around a given node with an extractor, followed by selecting communities that are similar to this local structure to distill useful communities. These selected communities are employed to train the expander, which expands the community containing a given node.

Namely, we tackle the problem that current video benchmarks may suffer from different representation biases, e.g., object bias or single-frame bias, where mere recognition of objects or utilization of only a single frame is sufficient for correct prediction. We leverage VLMs and LLMs to analyze and debias benchmarks from such representation biases. Specifically, we generate frame-wise textual descriptions of videos, filter them for specific information (e.g. only objects) and leverage them to examine representation biases across three dimensions: 1) concept bias - determining if a specific concept (e.g., objects) alone suffice for prediction; 2) temporal bias - assessing if temporal information contributes to prediction; and 3) common sense vs. dataset bias - evaluating whether zero-shot reasoning or dataset correlations contribute to prediction. We conduct a systematic analysis of 12 popular video classification and retrieval datasets and create new object-debiased test splits for these datasets. Moreover, we benchmark 30 state-of-the-art video models on original and debiased splits and analyze biases in the models. To facilitate the future development of more robust video understanding benchmarks and models, we release: ""UTD-descriptions"", a dataset with our rich structured descriptions for each dataset, and ""UTD-splits"", a dataset of object-debiased test splits.",2025-06-01,1,CVPR

Improving our understanding of diffusion models, including mainly convergence analysis for such models, has attracted a lot of interests.

Towards to close this gap, we establish an iteration complexity at the order of $d^{1/3}\varepsilon^{-2/3}$, which is better than $d^{5/12}\varepsilon^{-1}$, the best known complexity achieved before our work. This convergence analysis is based on a randomized midpoint method, which is first proposed for log-concave sampling (Shen & Lee, 2019), and then extended to diffusion models by Gupta et al. (2024). Our theory accommodates $\varepsilon$-accurate score estimates, and does not require log-concavity on the target distribution.

Building upon insights into the impact of the DIP input and drawing inspiration from the gradual denoising process in cutting-edge diffusion models, we introduce Autoencoding Sequential DIP (aSeqDIP) for image reconstruction. This method progressively denoises and reconstructs the image through a sequential optimization of network weights. This is achieved using an input-adaptive DIP objective, combined with an autoencoding regularization term. Compared to diffusion models, our method does not require training data and outperforms other DIP-based methods in mitigating noise overfitting while maintaining a similar number of parameter updates as Vanilla DIP.

We show that this concern manifests itself in the classical secretary problem in the learning-augmented setting---the state-of-the-art algorithm can have zero probability of accepting the best candidate, which we deem unfair, despite promising to accept a candidate whose expected value is at least $\max\{\Omega (1) , 1 - O(\varepsilon)\}$ times the optimal value, where $\varepsilon$ is the prediction error.We show how to preserve this promise while also guaranteeing to accept the best candidate with probability $\Omega(1)$.

These estimates are typically obtained via numerical optimization or regression by a deep network. A desirable property of such estimators is that a correspondence estimate (e.g., the true oracle correspondence) for an image pair is maintained under deformations of the input images. Formally, the estimator should be equivariant to a desired class of image transformations. In this work, we present careful analyses of the desired equivariance properties in the context of multi-step deep registration networks. Based on these analyses we 1) introduce the notions of $[U,U]$ equivariance (network equivariance to the same deformations of the input images) and $[W,U]$ equivariance (where input images can undergo different deformations); we 2) show that in a suitable multi-step registration setup it is sufficient for overall $[W,U]$ equivariance if the first step has $[W,U]$ equivariance and all others have $[U,U]$ equivariance; we 3) show that common displacement-predicting networks only exhibit $[U,U]$ equivariance to translations instead of the more powerful $[W,U]$ equivariance; and we 4) show how to achieve multi-step $[W,U]$ equivariance via a coordinate-attention mechanism combined with displacement-predicting refinement layers (CARL).

Current efforts have relied on unlearning techniques that try to erase the model's knowledge of unsafe concepts. While effective in reducing unwanted outputs, unlearning limits the model's capacity to discern between safe and unsafe content. In this work, we introduce a novel approach that shifts from unlearning to an awareness paradigm by leveraging the inherent hierarchical properties of the hyperbolic space. We propose to encode safe and unsafe content as an entailment hierarchy, where both are placed in different regions of hyperbolic space. Our HySAC, Hyperbolic Safety-Aware CLIP, employs entailment loss functions to model the hierarchical and asymmetrical relations between safe and unsafe image-text pairs. This modelling, ineffective in standard vision-language models due to their reliance on Euclidean embeddings, endows the model with awareness of unsafe content, enabling it to serve as both a multimodal unsafe classifier and a flexible content retriever, with the option to dynamically redirect unsafe queries toward safer alternatives or retain the original output.

Despite notable progress, it remains unclear to which extent modern representations can capture the causal relationships behind agent interactions. In this work, we take an in-depth look at the causal awareness of these representations, from computational formalism to real-world practice. First, we cast doubt on the notion of non-causal robustness studied in the recent CausalAgents benchmark. We show that recent representations are already partially resilient to perturbations of non-causal agents, and yet modeling indirect causal effects involving mediator agents remains challenging. To address this challenge, we introduce a metric learning approach that regularizes latent representations with causal annotations. Our controlled experiments show that this approach not only leads to higher degrees of causal awareness but also yields stronger out-of-distribution robustness. To further operationalize it in practice, we propose a sim-to-real causal transfer method via cross-domain multi-task learning.

Such a philosophy inspires us to study image-to-image (I2I) generation, where models can learn from in-the-wild images in a self-supervised manner. We first develop a pure vision-based training framework, Lumos, and confirm the feasibility and the scalability of learning I2I models.

We introduce a new tuning and inference strategy named CoT-Valve, designed to allow models to generate reasoning chains of varying lengths. To achieve this, we propose to identify a direction in the parameter space that, when manipulated, can effectively control the length of generated CoT. Moreover, we show that this property is valuable for compressing the reasoning chain.

For temporal modeling, the single-person-based methods concatenate two people into a single one directly, while the separate modeling-based methods skip the modeling of interaction sequences. The inadequate modeling described above resulted in sub-optimal performance and redundant model parameters.

This task is highly challenging due to the domain gap between 3D and 2D gaze, unknown screen poses, and limited training data. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework that bridges the gap between 3D and 2D gaze. Our framework contains a physics-based differentiable projection module with learnable parameters to model screen poses and project 3D gaze into 2D gaze. The framework is fully differentiable and can integrate into existing 3D gaze networks without modifying their original architecture. Additionally, we introduce a dynamic pseudo-labelling strategy for flipped images, which is particularly challenging for 2D labels due to unknown screen poses. To overcome this, we reverse the projection process by converting 2D labels to 3D space, where flipping is performed. Notably, this 3D space is not aligned with the camera coordinate system, so we learn a dynamic transformation matrix to compensate for this misalignment.

Hence, protecting facial privacy against unauthorized AFR systems is essential. Inspired by the generation capability of the emerging diffusion models, recent methods employ diffusion models to generate adversarial face images for privacy protection. However, they suffer from the diffusion purification effect, leading to a low protection success rate (PSR). In this paper, we first propose learning unconditional embeddings to increase the learning capacity for adversarial modifications and then use them to guide the modification of the adversarial latent code to weaken the diffusion purification effect. Moreover, we integrate an identity-preserving structure to maintain structural consistency between the original and generated images, allowing human observers to recognize the generated image as having the same identity as the original. Extensive experiments conducted on two public datasets, i.e., CelebA-HQ and LADN, demonstrate the superiority of our approach. The protected faces generated by our method outperform those produced by existing facial privacy protection approaches in terms of transferability and natural appearance.",2025-06-01,3,CVPR

Constrained decoding approaches mitigate this problem by greedily restricting what tokens an LLM can output at each step to guarantee that the output matches a given constraint. Specifically, in grammar-constrained decoding (GCD), the LLM's output must follow a given grammar. In this paper we demonstrate that GCD techniques (and in general constrained decoding techniques) can distort the LLM's distribution, leading to outputs that are grammatical but appear with likelihoods that are not proportional to the ones given by the LLM, and so ultimately are low-quality. We call the problem of aligning sampling with a grammar constraint, grammar-aligned decoding (GAD), and propose adaptive sampling with approximate expected futures (ASAp), a decoding algorithm that guarantees the output to be grammatical while provably producing outputs that match the conditional probability of the LLM's distribution conditioned on the given grammar constraint. Our algorithm uses prior sample outputs to soundly overapproximate the future grammaticality of different output prefixes. Our evaluation on code generation and structured NLP tasks shows how ASAp often produces outputs with higher likelihood (according to the LLM's distribution) than existing GCD techniques, while still enforcing the desired grammatical constraints.",2024-12-16,19,NeurIPS

Current reinforcement learning approaches face critical limitations: manually designed rewards lack scalability across diverse tasks, while demonstration-based methods struggle to generalize beyond their training distribution. We introduce GROVE, a generalized reward framework that enables open-vocabulary physical skill learning without manual engineering or task-specific demonstrations. Our key insight is that Large Language Models(LLMs) and Vision Language Models(VLMs) provide complementary guidance -- LLMs generate precise physical constraints capturing task requirements, while VLMs evaluate motion semantics and naturalness. Through an iterative design process, VLM-based feedback continuously refines LLM-generated constraints, creating a self-improving reward system. To bridge the domain gap between simulation and natural images, we develop Pose2CLIP, a lightweight mapper that efficiently projects agent poses directly into semantic feature space without computationally expensive rendering. Extensive experiments across diverse embodiments and learning paradigms demonstrate GROVE's effectiveness, achieving 22.2% higher motion naturalness and 25.7% better task completion scores while training 8.4x faster than previous methods.

Foster, Alexander Rakhlin","Simulators are a pervasive tool in reinforcement learning, but most existing algorithms cannot efficiently exploit simulator access -- particularly in high-dimensional domains that require general function approximation. We explore the power of simulators through online reinforcement learning with local simulator access (or, local planning), an RL protocol where the agent is allowed to reset to previously observed states and follow their dynamics during training. We use local simulator access to unlock new statistical guarantees that were previously out of reach:- We show that MDPs with low coverability (Xie et al. 2023) -- a general structural condition that subsumes Block MDPs and Low-Rank MDPs -- can be learned in a sample-efficient fashion with only Q⋆-realizability (realizability of the optimal state-value function); existing online RL algorithms require significantly stronger representation conditions.- As a consequence, we show that the notorious Exogenous Block MDP problem (Efroni et al. 2022) is tractable under local simulator access.The results above are achieved through a computationally inefficient algorithm. We complement them with a more computationally efficient algorithm, RVFS (Recursive Value Function Search), which achieves provable sample complexity guarantees under a strengthened statistical assumption known as pushforward coverability. RVFS can be viewed as a principled, provable counterpart to a successful empirical paradigm that combines recursive search (e.g., MCTS) with value function approximation.",2024-12-16,6,NeurIPS

While many vision tasks benefit from pre-trained feature backbones to improve generalizability, point tracking has primarily relied on simpler backbones trained from scratch on synthetic data, which may limit robustness in real-world scenarios. Additionally, point tracking requires temporal awareness to ensure coherence across frames, but using temporally-aware features is still underexplored. Most current methods often employ a two-stage process: an initial coarse prediction followed by a refinement stage to inject temporal information and correct errors from the coarse stage. These approach, however, is computationally expensive and potentially redundant if the feature backbone itself captures sufficient temporal information.In this work, we introduce Chrono, a feature backbone specifically designed for point tracking with built-in temporal awareness. Leveraging pre-trained representations from self-supervised learner DINOv2 and enhanced with a temporal adapter, Chrono effectively captures long-term temporal context, enabling precise prediction even without the refinement stage. Experimental results demonstrate that Chrono achieves state-of-the-art performance in a refiner-free setting on the TAP-Vid-DAVIS and TAP-Vid-Kinetics datasets, among common feature backbones used in point tracking as well as DINOv2, with exceptional efficiency.

However, despite their high-quality outputs, these models often perpetuate social biases, including those related to gender and race. These biases can potentially contribute to harmful real-world consequences, reinforcing stereotypes and exacerbating inequalities in various social contexts. While existing research on diffusion bias mitigation has predominantly focused on guiding content generation, it often neglects the intrinsic mechanisms within diffusion models that causally drive biased outputs. In this paper, we investigate the internal processes of diffusion models, identifying specific decision-making mechanisms, termed bias features, embedded within the model architecture. By directly manipulating these features, our method precisely isolates and adjusts the elements responsible for bias generation, permitting granular control over the bias levels in the generated content. Through experiments on both unconditional and conditional diffusion models across various social bias attributes, we demonstrate our method's efficacy in managing generation distribution while preserving image quality. We also dissect the discovered model mechanism, revealing different intrinsic features controlling fine-grained aspects of generation, boosting further research on mechanistic interpretability of diffusion models.",2025-06-01,2,CVPR

However, current methods fall short in achieving this level of generalization.

The core insight in UGP is the elimination of cross-attention mechanisms to improve generalization, allowing the network to concentrate on intra-frame feature extraction. Additionally, we introduce a progressive self-attention module to reduce ambiguity in large-scale scenes and integrate Bird's Eye View (BEV) features to incorporate semantic information about scene elements. Together, these enhancements significantly boost the network's generalization performance. We validated our approach through various generalization experiments in multiple outdoor scenes. In cross-distance generalization experiments on KITTI and nuScenes, UGP achieved state-of-the-art mean Registration Recall rates of 94.5% and 91.4%, respectively.

While LMMs have achieved tremendous success by promoting the synergy between multimodal comprehension and creation, they often face challenges when confronted with out-of-distribution data, such as which can hardly distinguish orientation, quantity, color, structure, etc. This is primarily due to their reliance on image encoders trained to encode images into task-relevant features, which may lead them to disregard irrelevant details. Delving into the modeling capabilities of diffusion models for images naturally prompts the question: Can diffusion models serve as the eyes of large language models for image perception? In this paper, we propose DEEM, a simple but effective approach that utilizes the generative feedback of diffusion models to align the semantic distributions of the image encoder. This addresses the drawbacks of previous methods that solely relied on image encoders like CLIP-ViT, thereby enhancing the model's resilience against out-of-distribution samples and reducing visual hallucinations. Importantly, this is achieved without requiring additional training modules and with fewer training parameters. We extensively evaluated DEEM on both our newly constructed RobustVQA benchmark and other well-known benchmarks, POPE and MMVP, for visual hallucination and perception. In particular, DEEM improves LMM's  visual perception performance to a large extent (e.g., 4\% ↑ on RobustVQA, 6.5\% ↑ on MMVP and 12.8 \% ↑ on POPE ). Compared to the state-of-the-art interleaved content generation models, DEEM  exhibits enhanced robustness and a superior capacity to alleviate model hallucinations while utilizing fewer trainable parameters, less pre-training data (10\%), and a smaller base model size.

Existing concept erasure methods achieve superior results in preventing the production of erased concept from prompts, but typically perform poorly in preventing undesired editing. To address this issue, we propose an Anti-Editing Concept Erasure (ACE) method, which not only erases the target concept during generation but also filters out it during editing. Specifically, we propose to inject the erasure guidance into both conditional and the unconditional noise prediction, enabling the model to effectively prevent the creation of erasure concepts during both editing and generation. Furthermore, a stochastic correction guidance is introduced during training to address the erosion of unrelated concepts. We conducted erasure editing experiments with representative editing methods (i.e., LEDITS++ and MasaCtrl) to erase IP characters, and the results indicate that our ACE effectively filters out target concepts in both types of edits.

In response to this challenge, we define a new benchmark, the OpenSDI dataset (OpenSDID), which stands out from existing datasets due to its diverse use of large vision-language models that simulate open-world diffusion-based manipulations. Another outstanding feature of OpenSDID is its inclusion of both detection and localization tasks for images manipulated globally and locally by diffusion models. To address the OpenSDI challenge, we propose a Synergizing Pretrained Models (SPM) scheme to build up a mixture of foundation models. This approach exploits a collaboration mechanism with multiple pretrained foundation models to enhance generalization in the OpenSDI context, moving beyond traditional training by synergizing multiple pretrained models through prompting and attending strategies. Building on this scheme, we introduce MaskCLIP, an SPM-based model that aligns Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) with Masked Autoencoder (MAE).

Our first contribution is to introduce CRISP, a category-agnostic object pose and shape estimation pipeline. The pipeline implements an encoder-decoder model for shape estimation. It uses FiLM-conditioning for implicit shape reconstruction and a DPT-based network for estimating pose-normalized points for pose estimation. As a second contribution, we propose an optimization-based pose and shape corrector that can correct estimation errors caused by a domain gap. Observing that the shape decoder is well behaved in the convex hull of known shapes, we approximate the shape decoder with an active shape model, and show that this reduces the shape correction problem to a constrained linear least squares problem, which can be solved efficiently by an interior point algorithm. Third, we introduce a self-training pipeline to perform self-supervised domain adaptation of CRISP. The self-training is based on a correct-and-certify approach, which leverages the corrector to generate pseudo-labels at test time, and uses them to self-train CRISP. We demonstrate CRISP (and the self-training) on YCBV, SPE3R, and NOCS datasets. CRISP shows high performance on all the datasets.

To systematically explore this phenomenon, we propose a dataset to evaluate the current diffusion-based text-to-image (T2I) models under such jailbreak. We benchmark nine representative T2I models, including two closed-source commercial models. Experimental results reveal a concerning tendency to produce unsafe content: all tested models suffer from such type of jailbreak, with rates of unsafe generation ranging from around 10% to 70% where DALL·E 3 demonstrates almost the highest unsafety.

(2) Occluded object parts demand a disciplined generation order and explicit part disentanglement. Though some works introduce manual efforts to alleviate the above issues, their quality is unstable and highly reliant on manual information. To tackle above problems, we propose a automated method Hierarchical-Chain-of-Generation (HCoG). It leverages a large language model to decompose the long description into blocks representing different object parts, and orders them from inside out according to occlusions, forming a hierarchical chain. Within each block we first coarsely create components, then precisely bind attributes via target-region localization and corresponding 3D Gaussian kernel optimization. Between blocks, we introduce Gaussian Extension and Label Elimination to seamlessly generate new parts by extending new Gaussian kernels, re-assigning semantic labels, and eliminating unnecessary kernels, ensuring that only relevant parts are added without disrupting previously optimized parts. Experiments confirm that HCoG yields structurally coherent, attribute-faithful 3D objects with complex attributes. The code is available atthis https URL.",2025-06-01,1,CVPR

Video frames inherently preserve the identity of subjects and scenes, ensuring consistent content preservation during editing. Additionally, video data captures diverse, natural dynamics-such as non-rigid subject motion and complex camera movements-that are difficult to model otherwise, making it an ideal source for scalable dataset construction. Using this approach, we create a new dataset to train InstructMove, a model capable of instruction-based complex manipulations that are difficult to achieve with synthetically generated datasets.

In this paper, we propose ESC-Net, a novel one-stage open-vocabulary segmentation model that leverages the SAM decoder blocks for class-agnostic segmentation within an efficient inference framework. By embedding pseudo prompts generated from image-text correlations into SAM's promptable segmentation framework, ESC-Net achieves refined spatial aggregation for accurate mask predictions.

In this paper, we present ObjectMover, a generative model that can perform object movement in highly challenging scenes. Our key insight is that we model this task as a sequence-to-sequence problem and fine-tune a video generation model to leverage its knowledge of consistent object generation across video frames. We show that with this approach, our model is able to adjust to complex real-world scenarios, handling extreme lighting harmonization and object effect movement. As large-scale data for object movement are unavailable, we construct a data generation pipeline using a modern game engine to synthesize high-quality data pairs. We further propose a multi-task learning strategy that enables training on real-world video data to improve the model generalization.

Traditional discriminative models trained on real-world data with sparse ground-truth depth can accurately predict metric depth but often produce over-smoothed or low-detail depth maps. Generative models, in contrast, are trained on synthetic data with dense ground truth, generating depth maps with sharp boundaries yet only providing relative depth with low accuracy. Our approach bridges these limitations by integrating metric accuracy with detailed boundary preservation, resulting in depth predictions that are both metrically precise and visually sharp. Our extensive zero-shot evaluations on standard depth estimation benchmarks confirm SharpDepth effectiveness, showing its ability to achieve both high depth accuracy and detailed representation, making it well-suited for applications requiring high-quality depth perception across diverse, real-world environments.",2025-06-01,4,CVPR

				746-754","Generative models have gained significant attention in multivariate time series forecasting (MTS), particularly due to their ability to generate high-fidelity samples. Forecasting the probability distribution of multivariate time series is a challenging yet practical task. Although some recent attempts have been made to handle this task, two major challenges persist: 1) some existing generative methods underperform in high-dimensional multivariate time series forecasting, which is hard to scale to higher dimensions; 2) The inherent high-dimensional multivariate attributes constrain the forecasting lengths of existing generative models. In this paper, we point out that discrete token representations can model high-dimensional MTS with faster inference time, and forecast the target with the long-term trends of itself can extend the forecasting length with high accuracy. Motivated by this, we propose a vector quantized framework called Hierarchical Discrete Transformer (HDT) that models time series into discrete token representations with l2 normalization enhanced vector quantized strategy, in which we transform the MTS forecasting into discrete tokens generation. To address the limitations of generative models in long-term forecasting, we propose a hierarchical discrete Transformer. This model captures the discrete long-term trend of the target at the low level and leverages this trend as a condition to generate the discrete representation of the target at the high level that introduces the features of target itself for extending the forecasting length in high-dimensional MTS. Extensive experiments on five popular MTS datasets verify the effectiveness of our proposed method. The source code will be released.",2025-04-11,2,AAAI

In this paper we observe that the initial iterations of model training play a key role in domain generalization effectiveness, since the loss landscape may be significantly different across the training and test distributions, contrary to the case of i.i.d. data. Conflicts between gradients of the loss components of each domain lead the optimization procedure to undesirable local minima that do not capture the domain-invariant features of the target classes. We propose alleviating domain conflicts in model optimization, by iteratively annealing the parameters of a model in the early stages of training and searching for points where gradients align between domains. By discovering a set of parameter values where gradients are updated towards the same direction for each data distribution present in the training set, the proposed Gradient-Guided Annealing (GGA) algorithm encourages models to seek out minima that exhibit improved robustness against domain shifts. The efficacy of GGA is evaluated on five widely accepted and challenging image classification domain generalization benchmarks, where its use alone is able to establish highly competitive or even state-of-the-art performance. Moreover, when combined with previously proposed domain-generalization algorithms it is able to consistently improve their effectiveness by significant margins.",2025-06-01,3,CVPR

Traditional methods, such as temporal attention and 3D convolution, may struggle with significant object motion and may not capture long-range temporal dependencies in dynamic scenes. To address this gap, we propose the Tracktention Layer, a novel architectural component that explicitly integrates motion information using point tracks, i.e., sequences of corresponding points across frames. By incorporating these motion cues, the Tracktention Layer enhances temporal alignment and effectively handles complex object motions, maintaining consistent feature representations over time. Our approach is computationally efficient and can be seamlessly integrated into existing models, such as Vision Transformers, with minimal modification. It can be used to upgrade image-only models to state-of-the-art video ones, sometimes outperforming models natively designed for video prediction. We demonstrate this on video depth prediction and video colorization, where models augmented with the Tracktention Layer exhibit significantly improved temporal consistency compared to baselines.",2025-06-01,1,CVPR

However, parameters tied to specific tasks often remain inactive for other tasks, making mixture-of-experts (MoE) architectures a natural extension. Despite this, MoEs often show inconsistent behavior, with some experts unexpectedly generalizing across tasks while others struggle within their intended scope. This hinders leveraging MoEs' computational benefits by bypassing irrelevant experts during inference. We attribute this undesired behavior to the uniform and rigid architecture of traditional MoEs. To address this, we introduce ``complexity experts"" -- flexible expert blocks with varying computational complexity and receptive fields. A key challenge is assigning tasks to each expert, as degradation complexity is unknown in advance. Thus, we execute tasks with a simple bias toward lower complexity. To our surprise, this preference effectively drives task-specific allocation, assigning tasks to experts with the appropriate complexity. Extensive experiments validate our approach, demonstrating the ability to bypass irrelevant experts during inference while maintaining superior performance.

Our approach employs a series of diffusion models to progressively generate latent variables at different semantic levels. Each model in this series is conditioned on the output of the preceding higher-level models, culminating in image generation. Hierarchical latent variables guide the generation process along predefined semantic pathways, allowing our approach to capture intricate structural details while significantly improving image quality. To construct these latent variables, we leverage a pre-trained visual encoder, which learns strong semantic visual representations, and modulate its capacity via dimensionality reduction and noise injection. Across multiple datasets, our system demonstrates significant enhancements in image quality for both unconditional and class/text conditional generation. Moreover, our unconditional generation system substantially outperforms the baseline conditional system.

We propose HisTPT, a Historical Test-time Prompt Tuning technique that memorizes the useful knowledge of the learnt test samples and enables robust test-time prompt tuning with the memorized knowledge. HisTPT introduces three types of knowledge banks, namely, local knowledge bank, hard-sample knowledge bank, and global knowledge bank, each of which works with different mechanisms for effective knowledge memorization and test-time prompt optimization. In addition, HisTPT features an adaptive knowledge retrieval mechanism that regularizes the prediction of each test sample by adaptively retrieving the memorized knowledge.

Based on the finding that existing tokenizers are tailored to either image or video inputs, this paper presents OmniTokenizer, a transformer-based tokenizer for joint image and video tokenization. OmniTokenizer is designed with a spatial-temporal decoupled architecture, which integrates window attention and causal attention for spatial and temporal modeling, respectively. To exploit the complementary nature of image and video data, we further propose a progressive training strategy, where OmniTokenizer is first trained on image data on a fixed resolution to develop the spatial encoding capacity and then jointly trained on image and video data on multiple resolutions to learn the temporal dynamics. OmniTokenizer, for the first time, handles both image and video inputs within a unified framework and proves the possibility of realizing their synergy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OmniTokenizer achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) reconstruction performance on various image and video datasets, e.g., 1.11 reconstruction FID on ImageNet and 42 reconstruction FVD on UCF-101, beating the previous SOTA methods by 13% and 26%, respectively.

First, a ranking of the examples generated for each prompt is obtained by employing a reward model. Then, increasingly difficult pairs of examples are sampled and provided to a text-to-image generative (diffusion or consistency) model. Generated samples that are far apart in the ranking are considered to form easy pairs, while those that are close in the ranking form hard pairs. In other words, we use the rank difference between samples as a measure of difficulty. The sampled pairs are split into batches according to their difficulty levels, which are gradually used to train the generative model.

While semantics and pragmatics are two fundamental aspects of language, they are typically studied independently and their co-evolution is largely under-explored. Here, we aim to bridge this gap by studying how a shared lexicon may emerge from local pragmatic interactions. To this end, we extend a recent information-theoretic framework for emergent communication in artificial agents, which integrates utility maximization, associated with pragmatics, with general communicative constraints that are believed to shape human semantic systems. Specifically, we show how to adapt this framework to train agents via unsupervised pragmatic interactions, and then evaluate their emergent lexical semantics. We test this approach in a rich visual domain of naturalistic images, and find that key human-like properties of the lexicon emerge when agents are guided by both context-specific utility and general communicative pressures, suggesting that both aspects are crucial for understanding how language may evolve in humans and in artificial agents.",2024-12-16,3,NeurIPS

Even small savings in the number of computations or memory usage in Jacobian computations can already incur massive savings in energy consumption and runtime. While there exist many methods that allow for such savings, they generally trade computational efficiency for approximations of the exact Jacobian.In this paper, we present a novel method to optimize the number of necessary multiplications for Jacobian computation by leveraging deep reinforcement learning (RL) and a concept called cross-country elimination while still computing the exact Jacobian. Cross-country elimination is a framework for automatic differentiation that phrases Jacobian accumulation as ordered elimination of all vertices on the computational graph where every elimination incurs a certain computational cost.Finding the optimal elimination order that minimizes the number of necessary multiplications can be seen as a single player game which in our case is played by an RL agent.We demonstrate that this method achieves up to 33% improvements over state-of-the-art methods on several relevant tasks taken from relevant domains.Furthermore, we show that these theoretical gains translate into actual runtime improvements by providing a cross-country elimination interpreter in JAX that can execute the obtained elimination orders.",2024-12-16,3,NeurIPS

This paradigm induces redundant computation and cumulative errors. In this work, we propose HandOS, an end-to-end framework for 3D hand reconstruction. Our central motivation lies in leveraging a frozen detector as the foundation while incorporating auxiliary modules for 2D and 3D keypoint estimation. In this manner, we integrate the pose estimation capacity into the detection framework, while at the same time obviating the necessity of using the left-right category as a prerequisite. Specifically, we propose an interactive 2D-3D decoder, where 2D joint semantics is derived from detection cues while 3D representation is lifted from those of 2D joints. Furthermore, hierarchical attention is designed to enable the concurrent modeling of 2D joints, 3D vertices, and camera translation. Consequently, we achieve an end-to-end integration of hand detection, 2D pose estimation, and 3D mesh reconstruction within a one-stage framework, so that the above multi-stage drawbacks are overcome.

To overcome these issues, this paper advances CLIP into one novel holistic paradigm, by updating both diverse data and alignment optimization. To obtain colorful data with low cost, we use image-to-text captioning to generate multi-texts for each image, from multiple perspectives, granularities, and hierarchies. Two gadgets are proposed to encourage textual diversity. To match such (image, multi-texts) pairs, we modify the CLIP image encoder into multi-branch, and propose multi-to-multi contrastive optimization for image-text part-to-part matching.

In BusrtSR, the key challenge lies in extracting the base frame's content complementary sub-pixel details while simultaneously suppressing high-frequency noise disturbance. Existing methods attempt to extract sub-pixels by modeling inter-frame relationships frame by frame while overlooking the mutual correlations among multi-current frames and neglecting the intra-frame interactions, leading to inaccurate and noisy sub-pixels for base frame super-resolution. Further, existing methods mainly employ static upsampling with fixed parameters to improve spatial resolution for all scenes, failing to perceive the sub-pixel distribution difference across multiple frames and cannot balance the fusion weights of different frames, resulting in over-smoothed details and artifacts. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel Query Mamba Burst Super-Resolution (QMambaBSR) network, which incorporates a Query State Space Model (QSSM) and Adaptive Up-sampling module (AdaUp). Specifically, based on the observation that sub-pixels have consistent spatial distribution while random noise is inconsistently distributed, a novel QSSM is proposed to efficiently extract sub-pixels through inter-frame querying and intra-frame scanning while mitigating noise interference in a single step. Moreover, AdaUp is designed to dynamically adjust the upsampling kernel based on the spatial distribution of multi-frame sub-pixel information in the different burst scenes, thereby facilitating the reconstruction of the spatial arrangement of high-resolution details.

We find that LLMs do encode long CoT reasoning as a general capability, with a clear distinction from vanilla CoTs. Furthermore, domain-specific representations are also required for the effective transfer of long CoT reasoning.

However, a significant lack of high-quality, human-centric video datasets presents a challenge to progress in this field. To bridge this gap, we introduce OpenHumanVid, a large-scale and high-quality human-centric video dataset characterized by precise and detailed captions that encompass both human appearance and motion states, along with supplementary human motion conditions, including skeleton sequences and speech audio. To validate the efficacy of this dataset and the associated training strategies, we propose an extension of existing classical diffusion transformer architectures and conduct further pretraining of our models on the proposed dataset. Our findings yield two critical insights: First, the incorporation of a large-scale, high-quality dataset substantially enhances evaluation metrics for generated human videos while preserving performance in general video generation tasks. Second, the effective alignment of text with human appearance, human motion, and facial motion is essential for producing high-quality video outputs. Based on these insights and corresponding methodologies, the straightforward extended network trained on the proposed dataset demonstrates an obvious improvement in the generation of human-centric videos.

Recent studies show that reasoning abilities contribute significantly to model safety, while integrating Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures can further enhance alignment.In this work, we address a fundamental question:How to effectively incorporate reasoning abilitiesand MoE architectures into self-alignment processin LLMs?We propose Mixture of insighTful Experts (MoTE), a novel framework that synergistically combines reasoning chains and expert mixtures to improve self-alignments.From a data perspective, MoTE employs a structured reasoning chain comprising four key stages: Question Analysis, Answer Guidance, Safe Answer, and Safety Checking. This approach enhances safety through multi-step reasoning and proves effective even for smaller and less powerful LLMs (e.g., 7B models). From an architectural perspective, MoTE adopts a multi-LoRA framework with step-level routing, where each expert is dedicated to a specific reasoning step. This design eliminates the need for balance losses, ensures stable training, and supports adaptive inference lengths. Experimental results demonstrate that MoTE significantly improves model safety, jailbreak resistance, and over-refusal capabilities, achieving performance comparable to OpenAI’s state-of-the-art o1 model.",2025-07-01,1,ACL

Current strategies for processing point clouds typically downsample the scene or divide it into smaller parts for separate analysis.

In this paper, we introduce PerLA, a 3D language assistant designed to be more perceptive to both details and context, making visual representations more informative for the LLM. PerLA captures high-resolution (local) details in parallel from different point cloud areas and integrates them with (global) context obtained from a lower-resolution whole point cloud.

In the ImageNet era of computer vision, evaluation sets for measuring a model's OOD performance were designed to be strictly OOD with respect to style. However, the emergence of foundation models and expansive web-scale datasets has obfuscated this evaluation process, as datasets cover a broad range of domains and risk test domain contamination. In search of the forgotten domain generalization, we create large-scale datasets subsampled from LAION---LAION-Natural and LAION-Rendition---that are strictly OOD to corresponding ImageNet and DomainNet test sets in terms of style. Training CLIP models on these datasets reveals that a significant portion of their performance is explained by in-domain examples. This indicates that the OOD generalization challenges from the ImageNet era still prevail and that training on web-scale data merely creates the illusion of OOD generalization.

A promising approach to addressing this challenge is distributionally robust RL, often framed as a robust Markov decision process (RMDP). In this framework, the objective is to find a robust policy that achieves good performance under the worst-case scenario among all environments within a pre-specified uncertainty set centered around the training environment. Unlike previous work, which relies on a generative model or a pre-collected offline dataset enjoying good coverage of the deployment environment, we tackle robust RL via interactive data collection, where the learner interacts with the training environment only and refines the policy through trial and error. In this robust RL paradigm, two main challenges emerge: managing distributional robustness while striking a balance between exploration and exploitation during data collection. Initially, we establish that sample-efficient learning without additional assumptions is unattainable owing to the curse of support shift; i.e., the potential disjointedness of the distributional supports between the training and testing environments. To circumvent such a hardness result, we introduce the vanishing minimal value assumption to RMDPs with a total-variation (TV) distance robust set, postulating that the minimal value of the optimal robust value function is zero. We prove that such an assumption effectively eliminates the support shift issue for RMDPs with a TV distance robust set, and present an algorithm with a provable sample complexity guarantee. Our work makes the initial step to uncovering the inherent difficulty of robust RL via interactive data collection and sufficient conditions for designing a sample-efficient algorithm accompanied by sharp sample complexity analysis.",2024-12-16,13,NeurIPS

Traditionally, the Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) test has been the primary measure for evaluating GNN expressiveness. However, high-order WL tests can be obscure, making it challenging to discern the specific graph patterns captured by them. Given the connection between WL tests and first-order logic, some have explored the logical expressiveness of Message Passing Neural Networks. This paper aims to establish a comprehensive and systematic relationship between GNNs and logic. We propose a framework for identifying the equivalent logical formulas for arbitrary GNN architectures, which not only explains existing models, but also provides inspiration for future research. As case studies, we analyze multiple classes of prominent GNNs within this framework, unifying different subareas of the field.

While the choice of prior strongly affects the resulting posterior distribution, computational tractability and lack of interpretability of the weight space typically limit the Laplace approximation to isotropic Gaussian priors, which are known to cause pathological behavior as depth increases. As a remedy, we directly place a prior on function space. More precisely, since Lebesgue densities do not exist on infinite-dimensional function spaces, we recast training as finding the so-called weak mode of the posterior measure under a Gaussian process (GP) prior restricted to the space of functions representable by the neural network. Through the GP prior, one can express structured and interpretable inductive biases, such as regularity or periodicity, directly in function space, while still exploiting the implicit inductive biases that allow deep networks to generalize. After model linearization, the training objective induces a negative log-posterior density to which we apply a Laplace approximation, leveraging highly scalable methods from matrix-free linear algebra.

Previous methods relying on 2D slice-based angiography synthesis struggle with maintaining continuity in 3D vascular structures and exhibit limited effectiveness across different imaging modalities. We propose VasTSD, a 3D vascular tree-state space diffusion model to synthesize angiography from 3D non-angiographic volumes, with a novel state space serialization approach that dynamically constructs vascular tree topologies, integrating these with a diffusion-based generative model to ensure the generation of anatomically continuous vasculature in 3D volumes.

This paper explores endogenous distribution shifts in learning systems, where deployed models influence environments and subsequently alter data distributions. This phenomenon is formulated by a decision-dependent distribution mapping within the recently proposed framework of performative prediction (PP) Perdomo et al. (2020). We investigate the performative effect in a decentralized noncooperative game, where players aim to minimize private cost functions while simultaneously managing coupled inequality constraints. Under performativity, we examine two equilibrium concepts for the studied game: performative stable equilibrium (PSE) and Nash equilibrium (NE), and establish sufficient conditions for their existence and uniqueness. Notably, we provide the first upper bound on the distance between the PSE and NE in the literature, which is challenging to evaluate due to the absence of strong convexity on the joint cost function. Furthermore, we develop a decentralized stochastic primal-dual algorithm for efficiently computing the PSE point. By carefully bounding the performative effect in theoretical analysis, we prove that the proposed algorithm achieves sublinear convergence rates for both performative regrets and constraint violation and maintains the same order of convergence rate as the case without performativity.

The inherent conflict above often leads to a back-and-forth, which turns the objective into finding the balance between the performance of previous~(old) and incremental~(new) classes. To address this conflict, we introduce a novel approach, Conflict Mitigation via Branched Optimization~(CoMBO). Within this approach, we present the Query Conflict Reduction module, designed to explicitly refine queries for new classes through lightweight, class-specific adapters. This module provides an additional branch for the acquisition of new classes while preserving the original queries for distillation. Moreover, we develop two strategies to further mitigate the conflict following the branched structure, \textit{i.e.}, the Half-Learning Half-Distillation~(HDHL) over classification probabilities, and the Importance-Based Knowledge Distillation~(IKD) over query features. HDHL selectively engages in learning for classification probabilities of queries that match the ground truth of new classes, while aligning unmatched ones to the corresponding old probabilities, thus ensuring retention of old knowledge while absorbing new classes via learning negative samples. Meanwhile, IKD assesses the importance of queries based on their matching degree to old classes, prioritizing the distillation of important features and allowing less critical features to evolve.

To understand their generalization behavior, existing works establish upper bounds on the uniform stability of these algorithms, while their tightness is still unclear. To this end, this paper attempts to establish stability lower bounds for UD-based and IFT-based algorithms. A central technical challenge arises from the dependency of each outer-level update on the concurrent stage of inner optimization in bilevel programming. To address this problem, we introduce lower-bounded expansion properties to characterize the instability in update rules which can serve as general tools for lower-bound analysis. These properties guarantee the hyperparameter divergence at the outer level and the Lipschitz constant of inner output at the inner level in the context of HO.Guided by these insights, we construct a quadratic example that yields tight lower bounds for the UD-based algorithm and meaningful bounds for a representative IFT-based algorithm.Our tight result indicates that uniform stability has reached its limit in stability analysis for the UD-based algorithm.",2024-12-16,1,NeurIPS

While these innovations offer numerous practical benefits, they also cause significant security challenges when maliciously misused. Therefore, there is an urgent need to detect these synthetic speech signals. Phoneme features provide a powerful speech representation for deepfake detection. However, previous phoneme-based detection approaches typically focused on specific phonemes, overlooking temporal inconsistencies across the entire phoneme sequence. In this paper, we develop a new mechanism for detecting speech deepfakes by identifying the inconsistencies of phoneme-level speech features. We design an adaptive phoneme pooling technique that extracts sample-specific phoneme-level features from frame-level speech data. By applying this technique to features extracted by pre-trained audio models on previously unseen deepfake datasets, we demonstrate that deepfake samples often exhibit phoneme-level inconsistencies when compared to genuine speech. To further enhance detection accuracy, we propose a deepfake detector that uses a graph attention network to model the temporal dependencies of phoneme-level features.

Motivated by ambiguity aversion in human behaviors, we propose a novel candidate annotation paradigm wherein large language models are encouraged to output all possible labels when incurring uncertainty. To ensure unique labels are provided for downstream tasks, we develop a teacher-student framework CanDist that distills candidate annotations with a Small Language Model (SLM).

We argue that the fluctuation stems from the inability of the model to accumulate the knowledge learned from diverse augmentations, exacerbating feature distortion during training. Based on this observation, we propose a novel generalization method, coined Parameter-Space Ensemble with Entropy Regularization (PEER), that uses a proxy model to learn the augmented data on behalf of the main model. The main model is updated by averaging its parameters with the proxy model, progressively accumulating knowledge over the training steps. Maximizing the mutual information between the output representations of the two models guides the learning process of the proxy model, mitigating feature distortion during training.

In this paper, we developed the Tree-structured Variational Inference (TreeVI), which uses a tree structure to capture the correlation of latent variables in the posterior distribution. We show that  samples from the tree-structured posterior can be reparameterized efficiently and parallelly, making its training cost just 2 or 3 times that of VI under the mean-field assumption. To capture correlation with more complicated structure, the TreeVI is further extended to the multiple-tree case.

We find that when certain visual patterns are repeatedly in the training data, the model learns to reproduce them naturally in its outputs, even without prompt mentions. Leveraging this, we develop an automated data poisoning algorithm that unobtrusively injects logos into original images, ensuring they blend naturally and remain undetected. Models trained on this poisoned dataset generate images containing logos without degrading image quality or text alignment.

Their predefined scanning directions depend on the original image orientation, which can cause the model to produce inconsistent patch-processing sequences after rotation. To address these limitations, we introduce Spectral VMamba, a novel approach that effectively captures the global structure within an image by leveraging spectral information derived from the graph Laplacian of image patches. Through spectral decomposition, our approach encodes patch relationships independently of image orientation, achieving rotation invariance with the aid of our Rotational Feature Normalizer (RFN) module. Our experiments on classification tasks show that Spectral VMamba outperforms the leading SSM models in vision, such as VMamba, while maintaining invariance to rotations and a providing a similar runtime efficiency.",2025-06-01,2,CVPR

Previous methods generally design task-specific architectures and objectives for individual tasks, resulting in modal isolation and intricate workflows. In this paper, we present a novel large vision-language model, TabPedia, equipped with a concept synergy mechanism. In this mechanism, all the involved diverse visual table understanding (VTU) tasks and multi-source visual embeddings are abstracted as concepts. This unified framework allows TabPedia to seamlessly integrate VTU tasks, such as table detection, table structure recognition, table querying, and table question answering, by leveraging the capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Moreover, the concept synergy mechanism enables table perception-related and comprehension-related tasks to work in harmony, as they can effectively leverage the needed clues from the corresponding source perception embeddings. Furthermore, to better evaluate the VTU task in real-world scenarios, we establish a new and comprehensive table VQA benchmark, ComTQA, featuring approximately 9,000 QA pairs. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments on both table perception and comprehension tasks, conducted across various public benchmarks, validate the effectiveness of our TabPedia. The superior performance further confirms the feasibility of using LLMs for understanding visual tables when all concepts work in synergy.

Our lower bound shows that how the geometry of the preferences and reward vectors changes the hardness of this problem. We further explicate this geometry for Gaussian distributions of rewards, and provide a convex reformulation of the lower bound solvable with linear programming.

With the advent of hybrid neural field representations like Instant NGP that leverage small MLPs and explicit representations, these models train quickly and can fit large scenes. Yet in many applications like rendering and simulation, hybrid neural fields can cause noticeable and unreasonable artifacts. This is because they do not yield accurate spatial derivatives needed for these downstream applications. In this work, we propose two ways to circumvent these challenges. Our first approach is a post hoc operator that uses local polynomial fitting to obtain more accurate derivatives from pre-trained hybrid neural fields. Additionally, we also propose a self-supervised fine-tuning approach that refines the hybrid neural field to yield accurate derivatives directly while preserving the initial signal. We show applications of our method to rendering, collision simulation, and solving PDEs.

We propose Fancy123, featuring two enhancement modules and an unprojection operation to address the above three issues, respectively. The appearance enhancement module deforms the 2D multiview images to realign misaligned pixels for better multiview consistency. The fidelity enhancement module deforms the 3D mesh to match the input image. The unprojection of the input image and deformed multiview images onto LRM's generated mesh ensures high clarity, discarding LRM's predicted blurry-looking mesh colors.

We demonstrate that when learning new information, LLMs exhibit a ""priming"" effect: learning a new fact can cause the model to inappropriately apply that knowledge in unrelated contexts.
To systematically study this phenomenon, we introduce ""Outlandish,"" a carefully curated dataset of 1320 diverse text samples designed to probe how new knowledge permeates through an LLM's existing knowledge base. Using this dataset, we show that the degree of priming after learning new information can be predicted by measuring the token probability of key words before training. This relationship holds robustly across different model architectures (PALM-2, Gemma, Llama), sizes, and training stages.
Finally, we develop two novel techniques to modulate how new knowledge affects existing model behavior: (1) a ``stepping-stone'' text augmentation strategy and (2) an ``ignore-k'' update pruning method. These approaches reduce undesirable priming effects by 50-95% while preserving the model's ability to learn new information.

We investigate VLMs' modality preferences when faced with visual data and varied textual inputs in vision-centered settings. By introducing textual variations to four vision-centric tasks and evaluating ten Vision-Language Models (VLMs), we discover a \emph{``blind faith in text''} phenomenon: VLMs disproportionately trust textual data over visual data when inconsistencies arise, leading to significant performance drops under corrupted text and raising safety concerns. We analyze factors influencing this text bias, including instruction prompts, language model size, text relevance, token order, and the interplay between visual and textual certainty. While certain factors, such as scaling up the language model size, slightly mitigate text bias, others like token order can exacerbate it due to positional biases inherited from language models. To address this issue, we explore supervised fine-tuning with text augmentation and demonstrate its effectiveness in reducing text bias. Additionally, we provide a theoretical analysis suggesting that the blind faith in text phenomenon may stem from an imbalance of pure text and multi-modal data during training.

Meanwhile, this robust pattern can be obtained from an `observation' window located at the end of the prompts. Drawing on this insight, SnapKV automatically compresses KV caches by selecting clustered important KV positions for each attention head. Our approach significantly reduces the growing computational overhead and memory footprint when processing long input sequences. Specifically, SnapKV achieves a consistent decoding speed with a 3.6x increase in generation speed and an 8.2x enhancement in memory efficiency compared to baseline when processing inputs of 16K tokens. At the same time, it maintains comparable performance to baseline models across 16 long sequence datasets. Moreover, SnapKV can process up to 380K context tokens on a single A100-80GB GPU using HuggingFace implementation with minor changes, exhibiting only a negligible accuracy drop in the Needle-in-a-Haystack test.

A commonly used method is to represent layout information as text tokens and interleave them with text content as inputs to the LLMs. However, such a method still demonstrates limitations, as it requires additional position IDs for tokens that are used to represent layout information. Due to the constraint on max position IDs, assigning them to layout information reduces those available for text content, reducing the capacity for the model to learn from the text during training, while also introducing a large number of potentially untrained position IDs during long-context inference, which can hinder performance on document understanding tasks.

Current approaches often rely on labor-intensive annotation processes which are inherently limited: objects can be described at an arbitrary level of detail (e.g., color vs. color shades), leading to ambiguities when the annotators are not instructed carefully. Furthermore, they operate within a predefined set of attributes, reducing scalability and adaptability to unforeseen downstream applications. We present Compositional Caching (ComCa), a training-free method for open-vocabulary attribute detection that overcomes these constraints. ComCa requires only the list of target attributes and objects as input, using them to populate an auxiliary cache of images by leveraging web-scale databases and Large Language Models to determine attribute-object compatibility. To account for the compositional nature of attributes, cache images receive soft attribute labels. Those are aggregated at inference time based on the similarity between the input and cache images, refining the predictions of underlying Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Importantly, our approach is model-agnostic, compatible with various VLMs. Experiments on public datasets demonstrate that ComCa significantly outperforms zero-shot and cache-based baselines, competing with recent training-based methods, proving that a carefully designed training-free approach can successfully address open-vocabulary attribute detection.",2025-06-01,1,CVPR

Cheung, Jing Qin","Integrating multi-modal clinical data, such as electronic health records (EHR) and chest X-ray images (CXR), is particularly beneficial for clinical prediction tasks. However, in a temporal setting, multi-modal data are often inherently asynchronous. EHR can be continuously collected but CXR is generally taken with a much longer interval due to its high cost and radiation dose. When clinical prediction is needed, the last available CXR image might have been outdated, leading to suboptimal predictions. To address this challenge, we propose DDL-CXR, a method that dynamically generates an up-to-date latent representation of the individualized CXR images. Our approach leverages latent diffusion models for patient-specific generation strategically conditioned on a previous CXR image and EHR time series, providing information regarding anatomical structures and disease progressions, respectively. In this way, the interaction across modalities could be better captured by the latent CXR generation process, ultimately improving the prediction performance. Experiments using MIMIC datasets show that the proposed model could effectively address asynchronicity in multimodal fusion and consistently outperform existing methods.",2024-12-16,3,NeurIPS

Nevertheless, prevalent AVQA approaches are prone to overlearning dataset biases, resulting in poor robustness. Furthermore, current datasets may not provide a precise diagnostic for these methods. To tackle these challenges, firstly, we propose a novel dataset,MUSIC-AVQA-R, crafted in two steps: rephrasing questions within the test split of a public dataset (MUSIC-AVQA) and subsequently introducing distribution shifts to split questions. The former leads to a large, diverse test space, while the latter results in a comprehensive robustness evaluation on rare, frequent, and overall questions. Secondly, we propose a robust architecture that utilizes a multifaceted cycle collaborative debiasing strategy to overcome bias learning. Experimental results show that this architecture achieves state-of-the-art performance on MUSIC-AVQA-R, notably obtaining a significant improvement of 9.32\%. Extensive ablation experiments are conducted on the two datasets mentioned to analyze the component effectiveness within the debiasing strategy.

However, due to the manufacturing constraints of compact devices and the inherent physical principles of imaging, dToF depth maps are sparse and noisy. In this paper, we propose a novel video depth completion method, called SVDC, by fusing the sparse dToF data with the corresponding RGB guidance. Our method employs a multi-frame fusion scheme to mitigate the spatial ambiguity resulting from the sparse dToF imaging. Misalignment between consecutive frames during multi-frame fusion could cause blending between object edges and the background, which results in a loss of detail. To address this, we introduce an adaptive frequency selective fusion (AFSF) module, which automatically selects convolution kernel sizes to fuse multi-frame features. Our AFSF utilizes a channel-spatial enhancement attention (CSEA) module to enhance features and generates an attention map as fusion weights. The AFSF ensures edge detail recovery while suppressing high-frequency noise in smooth regions. To further enhance temporal consistency, We propose a cross-window consistency loss to ensure consistent predictions across different windows, effectively reducing flickering.

In this work, we define 5 requirements for multi-threshold metrics in selective classification regarding task alignment, interpretability, and flexibility, and show how current approaches fail to meet them. We propose the Area under the Generalized Risk Coverage curve ($\mathrm{AUGRC}$), which meets all requirements and can be directly interpreted as the average risk of undetected failures.

To achieve both goals, a mainstream class of LLM unlearning methods introduces an optimization framework with a combination of two objectives – maximizing the prediction loss on the forget documents while minimizing that on the retain documents, which suffers from two challenges, degenerated output and catastrophic forgetting. In this paper, we propose a novel unlearning framework called Unlearning from Logit Difference (ULD), which introduces an assistant LLM that aims to achieve the opposite of the unlearning goals: remembering the forget documents and forgetting the retain knowledge. ULD then derives the unlearned LLM by computing the logit difference between the target and the assistant LLMs. We show that such reversed objectives would naturally resolve both aforementioned challenges while significantly improving the training efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method efficiently achieves the intended forgetting while preserving the LLM’s overall capabilities, reducing training time by more than threefold.

Accurate identification of rip currents remains challenging due to their amorphous nature and the lack of annotated data, which often requires expert knowledge. To address these issues, we present RipVIS, a large-scale video instance segmentation benchmark explicitly designed for rip current segmentation. RipVIS is an order of magnitude larger than previous datasets, featuring $184$ videos ($212,328$ frames), of which $150$ videos ($163,528$ frames) are with rip currents, collected from various sources, including drones, mobile phones, and fixed beach cameras. Our dataset encompasses diverse visual contexts, such as wave-breaking patterns, sediment flows, and water color variations, across multiple global locations, including USA, Mexico, Costa Rica, Portugal, Italy, Greece, Romania, Sri Lanka, Australia and New Zealand. Most videos are annotated at $5$ FPS to ensure accuracy in dynamic scenarios, supplemented by an additional $34$ videos ($48,800$ frames) without rip currents.

To overcome this challenge, researchers have started employing anomaly generation approaches to augment the anomaly dataset. However, existing anomaly generation methods suffer from limited diversity in the generated anomalies and struggle to achieve a seamless blending of this anomaly with the original image. Moreover, the generated mask is usually not aligned with the generated anomaly. In this paper, we overcome these challenges from a new perspective, simultaneously generating a pair of the overall image and the corresponding anomaly part. We propose DualAnoDiff, a novel diffusion-based few-shot anomaly image generation model, which can generate diverse and realistic anomaly images by using a dual-interrelated diffusion model, where one of them is employed to generate the whole image while the other one generates the anomaly part. Moreover, we extract background and shape information to mitigate the distortion and blurriness phenomenon in few-shot image generation.

To address the inherent ill-posedness of inverse rendering, basis BRDF representations are commonly used, modeling SVBRDFs as spatially varying blends of a set of basis BRDFs. However, existing methods often yield basis BRDFs that lack intuitive separation and have limited scalability to scenes of varying complexity. In this paper, we introduce a differentiable inverse rendering method that produces interpretable basis BRDFs. Our approach models a scene using 2D Gaussians, where the reflectance of each Gaussian is defined by a weighted blend of basis BRDFs. We efficiently render an image from the 2D Gaussians and basis BRDFs using differentiable rasterization and impose a rendering loss with the input images. During this analysis-by-synthesis optimization process of differentiable inverse rendering, we dynamically adjust the number of basis BRDFs to fit the target scene while encouraging sparsity in the basis weights. This ensures that the reflectance of each Gaussian is represented by only a few basis BRDFs. This approach enables the reconstruction of accurate geometry and interpretable basis BRDFs that are spatially separated. Consequently, the resulting scene representation, comprising basis BRDFs and 2D Gaussians, supports physically-based novel-view relighting and intuitive scene editing.",2025-06-01,2,CVPR

We introduce the Gated Sparse Autoencoder (Gated SAE), which achieves a Pareto improvement over training with prevailing methods. In SAEs, the L1 penalty used to encourage sparsity introduces many undesirable biases, such as shrinkage -- systematic underestimation of feature activations. The key insight of Gated SAEs is to separate the functionality of (a) determining which directions to use and (b) estimating the magnitudes of those directions: this enables us to apply the L1 penalty only to the former, limiting the scope of undesirable side effects. Through training SAEs on LMs of up to 7B parameters we find that, in typical hyper-parameter ranges, Gated SAEs solve shrinkage, are similarly interpretable, and require half as many firing features to achieve comparable reconstruction fidelity.",2024-12-16,15,NeurIPS

Traditional online algorithms typically assume a small bid setting, where the maximum bid-to-budget ratio ($\kappa$) is infinitesimally small. While recent algorithms have tried to address scenarios with non-small or general bids, they often rely on the Fractional Last Matching (FLM) assumption, which allows for accepting partial bids when the remaining budget is insufficient. This assumption, however, does not hold for many applications with indivisible bids. In this paper, we remove the FLM assumption and tackle the open problem of OBM with general bids. We first establish an upper bound of $1-\kappa$ on the competitive ratio for any deterministic online algorithm. We then propose a novel meta algorithm, called MetaAd, which reduces to different algorithms with first known provable competitive ratios parameterized by the maximum bid-to-budget ratio $\kappa\in [0,1]$.

Additionally, interactions in dual-stream networks follow a fixed pattern across different layers, limiting overall performance. To address these limitations, we propose a novel architecture called Reversible Decoupling Network (RDNet), which employs a reversible encoder to secure valuable information while flexibly decoupling transmission- and reflection-relevant features during the forward pass. Furthermore, we customize a transmission-rate-aware prompt generator to dynamically calibrate features, further boosting performance.

However, current methods still fall short in accurately scoring image quality. In this work, we aim to leverage MLLMs to regress accurate quality scores. A key challenge is that the quality score is inherently continuous, typically modeled as a Gaussian distribution, whereas MLLMs generate discrete token outputs. This mismatch necessitates score discretization. Previous approaches discretize the mean score into a one-hot label, resulting in information loss and failing to capture inter-image relationships. We propose a distribution-based approach that discretizes the score distribution into a soft label. This method preserves the characteristics of the score distribution, achieving high accuracy and maintaining inter-image relationships.

First, we propose a prosody-enhanced acoustic pre-training to develop robust acoustic modeling capabilities. Then, we freeze the pre-trained acoustic system and design a disentangled framework to model prosodic text features and dubbing style while maintaining acoustic quality. Additionally, we incorporate an in-domain emotion analysis module to reduce the impact of visual domain shifts across different movies, thereby enhancing emotion-prosody alignment.

Existing TIL methodologies operate under the closed-world assumption, presuming that incoming data remains in-distribution (ID). However, in an open-world setting, incoming samples may originate from out-of-distribution (OOD) sources, with their task identities inherently unknown. Continually detecting OOD samples presents several challenges for current OOD detection methods: reliance on model outputs leads to excessive dependence on model performance, selecting suitable thresholds is difficult, hindering real-world deployment, and binary ID/OOD classification fails to provide task-level identification. To address these issues, we propose a novel continual OOD detection method called the Hierarchical Two-sample Tests (H2ST). H2ST eliminates the need for threshold selection through hypothesis testing and utilizes feature maps to better exploit model capabilities without excessive dependence on model performance. The proposed hierarchical architecture enables task-level detection with superior performance and lower overhead compared to non-hierarchical classifier two-sample tests. Extensive experiments and analysis validate the effectiveness of H2ST in open-world TIL scenarios and its superiority to the existing methods.

				451-459","Deep learning has been widely applied to various aspects of computer vision, but the emergence of adversarial attacks raises concerns about its reliability.
Adversarial training (AT) is one of the most effective defense methods, which incorporates adversarial examples into the training data.
However, AT is typically employed in a discriminative learning manner, i.e., learning the mapping (conditional probability) from samples to labels, it essentially reinforces this mapping without considering the underlying data distribution.
It is notable that adversarial examples often deviate from the distribution of normal (clean) samples.
Therefore, building upon existing adversarial defense schemes, we propose to further exploit the distribution of normal samples, partly from the generative learning perspective, resulting in a novel robustness enhancement paradigm.
We train a simple autoencoder (AE) autoregressively on normal samples to learn their prior distribution, effectively serving as an image manifold. This AE is then used as a manifold projection operator to incorporate the distribution information of normal samples.
Specifically, we organically integrate the pretrained AE into the training process of both AT and adversarial distillation (AD), a method aiming at improving the robustness of small models with low capacity.
Since the AE captures the distribution of normal samples, it can adaptively pull adversarial examples closer to the normal sample manifold, weakening the attack strength of adversarial samples and easing the learning of mappings from adversarial samples to correct labels.
From the Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) between the statistics on normal and adversarial examples, it’s validated that the AE indeed pulls adversarial samples closer to normal samples.
Extensive experiments illustrate that our proposed adversarial defense paradigm significantly improves the robustness compared with previous state-of-the-art AT and AD methods.",2025-04-11,1,AAAI

Recently, Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) of foundation models has shown promising results in the context of DG problem. Nevertheless, existing PEFT methods still struggle to strike a balance between preserving generalizable components of the pre-trained model and learning task-specific features. To gain insights into the distribution of generalizable components, we begin by analyzing the pre-trained weights through the lens of singular value decomposition. Building on these insights, we introduce Singular Value Decomposed Minor Components Adaptation (SoMA), an approach that selectively tunes minor singular components while keeping the residual parts frozen. SoMA effectively retains the generalization ability of the pre-trained model while efficiently acquiring task-specific skills. Moreover, we freeze domain-generalizable blocks and employ an annealing weight decay strategy, thereby achieving an optimal balance in the delicate trade-off between generalizability and discriminability. SoMA attains state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmarks that span both domain generalized semantic segmentation to domain generalized object detection.

Existing methods rely on direct matching for end-to-end lifting, yielding inferior results; or employ a two-stage solution constrained by complex pre- or post-processing. In this work, we design a new end-to-end object-aware lifting approach, named Unified-Lift that provides accurate 3D segmentation based on the 3D Gaussian representation. To start, we augment each Gaussian point with an additional Gaussian-level feature learned using a contrastive loss to encode instance information. Importantly, we introduce a learnable object-level codebook to account for individual objects in the scene for an explicit object-level understanding and associate the encoded object-level features with the Gaussian-level point features for segmentation predictions. While promising, achieving effective codebook learning is non-trivial and a naive solution leads to degraded performance. Therefore, we formulate the association learning module and the noisy label filtering module for effective and robust codebook learning. We conduct experiments on three benchmarks: LERF-Masked, Replica, and Messy Rooms datasets.

Yet the effectiveness of LLM-based approaches in real-world applications remains under explored. This study measures the knowledge users acquire with topic models—including traditional, unsupervised and supervised LLM- based approaches—on two datasets. While LLM-based methods generate more human- readable topics and show higher average win probabilities than traditional models for data exploration, they produce overly generic topics for domain-specific datasets that do not easily allow users to learn much about the documents. Adding human supervision to LLM-based topic models improves data exploration by addressing hallucination and genericity but requires more human efforts. In contrast, traditional models like Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) remain effective for exploration but are less user-friendly.

Existing sparse-to-dense approaches typically employ shared context-independent queries across various input images, which fails to capture distinctions among them as the focal regions of different inputs vary and may result in undirected feature aggregation of cross-attention. Additionally, the absence of depth information may lead to points projected onto the image plane sharing the same 2D position or similar sampling points in the feature map, resulting in depth ambiguity. In this paper, we present a novel context and geometry aware voxel transformer. It utilizes a context aware query generator to initialize context-dependent queries tailored to individual input images, effectively capturing their unique characteristics and aggregating information within the region of interest. Furthermore, it extend deformable cross-attention from 2D to 3D pixel space, enabling the differentiation of points with similar image coordinates based on their depth coordinates. Building upon this module, we introduce a neural network named CGFormer to achieve semantic scene completion. Simultaneously, CGFormer leverages multiple 3D representations (i.e., voxel and TPV) to boost the semantic and geometric representation abilities of the transformed 3D volume from both local and global perspectives.

At its core, the attention block differs in form and functionality from most other architectural components in deep learning—to the extent that, in comparison to MLPs/CNNs, Transformers are more often accompanied by adaptive optimizers, layer normalization, learning rate warmup, etc. The root causes behind these outward manifestations and the precise mechanisms that govern them remain poorly understood. In this work, we bridge this gap by providing a fundamental understanding of what distinguishes the Transformer from the other architectures—grounded in a theoretical comparison of the (loss) Hessian. Concretely, for a single self-attention layer, (a) we first entirely derive the Transformer’s Hessian and express it in matrix derivatives; (b) we then characterize it in terms of data, weight, and attention moment dependencies; and (c) while doing so further highlight the important structural differences to the Hessian of classical networks.

Current research primarily focuses on the Single-Label Backdoor Attack (SBA), wherein adversaries share a consistent target. However, a critical fact is overlooked: adversaries may be non-cooperative, have distinct targets, and operate independently, which exhibits a more practical scenario called Multi-Label Backdoor Attack (MBA). Unfortunately, prior works are ineffective in the MBA scenario since non-cooperative attackers exclude each other. In this work, we conduct an in-depth investigation to uncover the inherent constraints of the exclusion: similar backdoor mappings are constructed for different targets, resulting in conflicts among backdoor functions. To address this limitation, we propose Mirage, the first non-cooperative MBA strategy in FL that allows attackers to inject effective and persistent backdoors into the global model without collusion by constructing in-distribution (ID) backdoor mapping. Specifically, we introduce an adversarial adaptation method to bridge the backdoor features and the target distribution in an ID manner.

Adversarial Training (AT) is a mainstream approach to enhancing Adversarial Robustness (AR) and has been validated on various traditional DNN architectures. However, its effectiveness in improving the AR of SSMs remains unclear.While many enhancements in SSM components, such as integrating Attention mechanisms and expanding to data-dependent SSM parameterizations, have brought significant gains in Standard Training (ST) settings, their potential benefits in AT remain unexplored. To investigate this, we evaluate existing structural variants of SSMs with AT to assess their AR performance. We observe that pure SSM structures struggle to benefit from AT, whereas incorporating Attention yields a markedly better trade-off between robustness and generalization for SSMs in AT compared to other components. Nonetheless, the integration of Attention also leads to Robust Overfitting (RO) issues.To understand these phenomena, we empirically and theoretically  analyze the output error of SSMs under AP. We find that fixed-parameterized SSMs have output error bounds strictly related to their parameters, limiting their AT benefits, while input-dependent SSMs may face the problem of error explosion. Furthermore, we show that the Attention component effectively scales the output error of SSMs during training, enabling them to benefit more from AT, but at the cost of introducing RO due to its high model complexity.Inspired by this, we propose a simple and effective Adaptive Scaling (AdS) mechanism that brings AT performance close to Attention-integrated SSMs without introducing the issue of RO.",2024-12-16,2,NeurIPS

One reason for this is the intractability of analyzing NNs, ODEs and hybrid systems. To this end, we introduce VerSAILLE (Verifiably Safe AI via Logically Linked Envelopes): The first general approach that allows reusing control theory literature for NNCS verification. By joining forces, we can exploit the efficiency of NN verification tools while retaining the rigor of differential dynamic logic (dL). Based on a provably safe control envelope in dL, we derive a specification for the NN which is proven with NN verification tools. We show that a proof of the NN’s adherence to the specification is then mirrored by a dL proof on the infinite-time safety of the NNCS.The NN verification properties resulting from hybrid systems typically contain nonlinear arithmetic over formulas with arbitrary logical structure while efficient NN verification tools merely support linear constraints. To overcome this divide, we present Mosaic: An efficient, sound and complete verification approach for polynomial real arithmetic properties on piece-wise linear NNs. Mosaic partitions complex NN verification queries into simple queries and lifts off-the-shelf linear constraint tools to the nonlinear setting in a completeness-preserving manner by combining approximation with exact reasoning for counterexample regions. In our evaluation we demonstrate the versatility of VerSAILLE and Mosaic: We prove infinite-time safety on the classical Vertical Airborne Collision Avoidance NNCS verification benchmark for some scenarios while (exhaustively) enumerating counterexample regions in unsafe scenarios. We also show that our approach significantly outperforms the State-of-the-Art tools in closed-loop NNV",2024-12-16,12,NeurIPS

Our system operates on linear (RAW) photos, and accepts an optional contextual photo looking in the opposite direction (e.g., the ""selfie"" camera on a mobile device). This optional photo disambiguates what should be considered the reflection. The system is trained solely on synthetic mixtures of real RAW photos, which we combine using a reflection simulation that is photometrically and geometrically accurate. Our system comprises a base model that accepts the captured photo and optional context photo as input, and runs at 256p, followed by an up-sampling model that transforms 256p images to full resolution. The system produces preview images at 1K in 4.5-6.5s on a MacBook or iPhone 14 Pro.

Unlike previous methods that typically struggle with sparse views with few overlappings and are less effective in reconstructing complex human geometry, the proposed method enables robust reconstruction in such challenging conditions. Our key idea is to lift SMPL vertices to dense and reliable 3D prior points representing accurate human body geometry, and then regress human Gaussian parameters based on the points. To account for possible misalignment between SMPL model and images, we propose to predict image-aligned 3D prior points by leveraging both pixel-level features and voxel-level features, from which we regress the coarse Gaussians. To enhance the ability to capture high-frequency details, we further render depth maps from the coarse 3D Gaussians to help regress fine-grained pixel-wise Gaussians.

In this paper, we introduce Neural Isometries, an autoencoder framework which learns to map the observation space to a general-purpose latent space wherein encodings are related by isometries whenever their corresponding observations are geometrically related in world space. Specifically, we regularize the latent space such that maps between encodings preserve a learned inner product and commute with a learned functional operator, in the same manner as rigid-body transformations commute with the Laplacian. This approach forms an effective backbone for self-supervised representation learning, and we demonstrate that a simple off-the-shelf equivariant network operating in the pre-trained latent space can achieve results on par with meticulously-engineered, handcrafted networks designed to handle complex, nonlinear symmetries. Furthermore, isometric maps capture information about the respective transformations in world space, and we show that this allows us to regress camera poses directly from the coefficients of the maps between encodings of adjacent views of a scene.",2024-12-16,1,NeurIPS

The existing approaches, such as the OSG algorithm,  are often hindered by their poor approximation guarantees and the rigid requirement for a fully connected communication graph. To address these challenges, we firstly present a $\textbf{MA-OSMA}$ algorithm, which employs the multi-linear extension to transfer the discrete submodular maximization problem into a continuous optimization, thereby allowing us to reduce the strict dependence on a complete graph through consensus techniques. Moreover, $\textbf{MA-OSMA}$ leverages a novel surrogate gradient to avoid sub-optimal stationary points. To eliminate the computationally intensive projection operations in $\textbf{MA-OSMA}$, we also introduce a projection-free $\textbf{MA-OSEA}$ algorithm, which effectively utilizes the KL divergence by mixing a uniform distribution. Theoretically, we confirm that both algorithms achieve a regret bound of $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{\frac{C_{T}T}{1-\beta}})$ against a  $(\frac{1-e^{-c}}{c})$-approximation to the best comparator in hindsight, where $C_{T}$ is the deviation of maximizer sequence, $\beta$ is the spectral gap of the network and $c$ is the joint curvature of submodular objectives.

DAG generative models facilitate the creation of synthetic DAGs, which can be used for benchmarking computing systems while preserving intellectual property. However, generating realistic DAGs is challenging due to their inherent directional and logical dependencies. This paper introduces LayerDAG, an autoregressive diffusion model, to address these challenges. LayerDAG decouples the strong node dependencies into manageable units that can be processed sequentially. By interpreting the partial order of nodes as a sequence of bipartite graphs, LayerDAG leverages autoregressive generation to model directional dependencies and employs diffusion models to capture logical dependencies within each bipartite graph. Comparative analyses demonstrate that LayerDAG outperforms existing DAG generative models in both expressiveness and generalization, particularly for generating large-scale DAGs with up to 400 nodes—a critical scenario for system benchmarking. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world flow graphs from various computing platforms show that LayerDAG generates valid DAGs with superior statistical properties and benchmarking performance. The synthetic DAGs generated by LayerDAG enhance the training of ML-based surrogate models, resulting in improved accuracy in predicting performance metrics of real-world DAGs across diverse computing platforms.",2024-10-04,4,ICLR

Various scoring functions are proposed to distinguish it from in-distribution (ID) data. However, existing methods generally focus on excavating the discriminative information from a single input, which implicitly limits its representation dimension. In this work, we introduce a novel perspective, i.e., employing different common corruptions on the input space, to expand that. We reveal an interesting phenomenon termedconfidence mutation, where the confidence of OOD data can decrease significantly under the corruptions, while the ID data shows a higher confidence expectation considering the resistance of semantic features. Based on that, we formalize a new scoring method, namely,Confidence aVerage(CoVer), which can capture the dynamic differences by simply averaging the scores obtained from different corrupted inputs and the original ones, making the OOD and ID distributions more separable in detection tasks.

The problem pertains to the performative prediction setting in which a trained model can affect the outcome estimated by the model. Such dependency creates a feedback loop that influences the stability of optimization algorithms such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD). We present the first study on performative prediction with smooth but possibly non-convex loss. We analyze a greedy deployment scheme with SGD (SGD-GD). Note that in the literature, SGD-GD is often studied with strongly convex loss. We first propose the definition of stationary performative stable (SPS) solutions through relaxing the popular performative stable condition. We then prove that SGD-GD converges to a biased SPS solution in expectation. We consider two conditions of sensitivity on the distribution shifts: (i) the sensitivity is characterized by Wasserstein-1 distance and the loss is Lipschitz w.r.t.~data samples, or (ii) the sensitivity is characterized by total variation (TV) divergence and the loss is bounded. In both conditions, the bias levels are proportional to the stochastic gradient's variance and sensitivity level. Our analysis is extended to a lazy deployment scheme where models are deployed once per several SGD updates, and we show that it converges to an SPS solution with reduced bias.

Inspired by recent advances in vision-language foundation models, we investigate their utility for WSTVG, leveraging their zero-shot grounding capabilities. However, we find that a simple adaptation lacks essential spatio-temporal grounding abilities. To bridge this gap, we introduce Tubelet Referral Grounding (TRG), which connects textual queries to tubelets to enable spatio-temporal predictions. Despite its promise, TRG struggles with compositional action understanding and dense scene scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose STPro, a novel progressive learning framework with two key modules: (1) Sub-Action Temporal Curriculum Learning (SA-TCL), which incrementally builds compositional action understanding, and (2) Congestion-Guided Spatial Curriculum Learning (CG-SCL), which adapts the model to complex scenes by spatially increasing task difficulty.

This is important for various applications from technical documents, to children's books to illustrating cooking recipes. Generating object-correct counts is fundamentally challenging because the generative model needs to keep a sense of separate identity for every instance of the object, even if several objects look identical or overlap, and then carry out a global computation implicitly during generation. It is still unknown if such representations exist. To address count-correct generation, we first identify features within the diffusion model that can carry the object identity information. We then use them to separate and count instances of objects during the denoising process and detect over-generation and under-generation. We fix the latter by training a model that predicts both the shape and location of a missing object, based on the layout of existing ones, and show how it can be used to guide denoising with correct object count. Our approach, CountGen, does not depend on external source to determine object layout, but rather uses the prior from the diffusion model itself, creating prompt-dependent and seed-dependent layouts. Evaluated on two benchmark datasets, we find that CountGen strongly outperforms the count-accuracy of existing baselines.",2025-06-01,23,CVPR

Theoretically, however, denoising with CFG \textit{cannot} be expressed as a reciprocal diffusion process, which may consequently leave some hidden risks during use. In this work, we revisit the theory behind CFG and rigorously confirm that the improper configuration of the combination coefficients (\textit{i.e.}, the widely used summing-to-one version) brings about expectation shift of the generative distribution. To rectify this issue, we propose ReCFG with a relaxation on the guidance coefficients such that denoising with \method strictly aligns with the diffusion theory. We further show that our approach enjoys a \textbf{\textit{closed-form}} solution given the guidance strength. That way, the rectified coefficients can be readily pre-computed via traversing the observed data, leaving the sampling speed barely affected.

A potential solution to better aesthetics is direct preference optimization (DPO), which has been applied to diffusion models to improve general image quality including prompt alignment and aesthetics. Popular DPO methods propagate preference labels from clean image pairs to all the intermediate steps along the two generation trajectories. However, preference labels provided in existing datasets are blended with layout and aesthetic opinions, which would disagree with aesthetic preference. Even if aesthetic labels were provided (at substantial cost), it would be hard for the two-trajectory methods to capture nuanced visual differences at different steps. To improve aesthetics economically, this paper uses existing generic preference data and introduces step-by-step preference optimization (SPO) that discards the propagation strategy and allows fine-grained image details to be assessed. Specifically, at each denoising step, we 1) sample a pool of candidates by denoising from a shared noise latent, 2) use a step-aware preference model to find a suitable win-lose pair to supervise the diffusion model, and 3) randomly select one from the pool to initialize the next denoising step. This strategy ensures that diffusion models focus on the subtle, fine-grained visual differences instead of layout aspect. We find that aesthetics can be significantly enhanced by accumulating these improved minor differences. When fine-tuning Stable Diffusion v1.5 and SDXL, SPO yields significant improvements in aesthetics compared with existing DPO methods while not sacrificing image-text alignment compared with vanilla models. Moreover, SPO converges much faster than DPO methods due to the use of more correct preference labels provided by the step-aware preference model.",2025-06-01,20,CVPR

At the core of our approach is the observation that INRs can be considered as a learnable dictionary, with the shapes of the basis functions governed by the weights of the INR, and their locations governed by the biases. Given compact non-linear activation functions, we hypothesize that an INR's biases are suitable to capture motion across images, and facilitate compact representations for video sequences. Using these observations, we design ActINR to share INR weights across frames of a video sequence, while using unique biases for each frame. We further model the biases as the output of a separate INR conditioned on time index to promote smoothness. By training the video INR and this bias INR together, we demonstrate unique capabilities, including $10\times$ video slow motion, 4x spatial super resolution along with 2x slow motion, denoising, and video inpainting.

Building on this idea, we propose a new method to construct MoE variants from pretrained models. Our approach extracts expert subnetworks from the model's MLP layers post-training in two phases. First, we cluster output activations to identify distinct activation patterns. In the second phase, we use these clusters to extract the corresponding subnetworks responsible for producing them.

Calderon, Alvaro Soto","Deep neural networks (DNNs) struggle at systematic generalization (SG). Several studies have evaluated the possibility to promote SG through the proposal of novel architectures, loss functions or training methodologies. Few studies, however, have focused on the role of training data properties in promoting SG. In this work, we investigate the impact of certain data distributional properties, as inductive biases for the SG ability of a multi-modal language model. To this end, we study three different properties. First, data diversity, instantiated as an increase in the possible values a latent property in the training distribution may take. Second, burstiness, where we probabilistically restrict the number of possible values of latent factors on particular inputs during training. Third, latent intervention, where a particular latent factor is altered randomly during training. We find that all three factors significantly enhance SG, with diversity contributing an 89% absolute increase in accuracy in the most affected property. Through a series of experiments, we test various hypotheses to understand why these properties promote SG. Finally, we find that Normalized Mutual Information (NMI) between latent attributes in the training distribution is strongly predictive of out-of-distribution generalization. We find that a mechanism by which lower NMI induces SG is in the geometry of representations. In particular, we find that NMI induces more parallelism in neural representations (i.e., input features coded in parallel neural vectors) of the model, a property related to the capacity of reasoning by analogy.",2025-06-01,1,CVPR
4e4d5d36-676e-4584-8706-4777803d4c18,One-to-Multiple: A Progressive Style Transfer Unsupervised Domain-Adaptive Framework for Kidney Tumor Segmentation,"Kai Hu, Jinhao Li, Yuan Zhang, Xiongjun Ye, Xieping Gao","In multi-sequence Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), the accurate segmentation of the kidney and tumor based on traditional supervised methods typically necessitates detailed annotation for each sequence, which is both time-consuming and labor-intensive. Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) methods can effectively mitigate inter-domain differences by aligning cross-modal features, thereby reducing the annotation burden. However, most existing UDA methods are limited to one-to-one domain adaptation, which tends to be inefficient and resource-intensive when faced with multi-target domain transfer tasks. To address this challenge, we propose a novel and efficient One-to-Multiple Progressive Style Transfer Unsupervised Domain-Adaptive (PSTUDA) framework for kidney and tumor segmentation in multi-sequence MRI. Specifically, we develop a multi-level style dictionary to explicitly store the style information of each target domain at various stages, which alleviates the burden of a single generator in a multi-target transfer task and enables effective decoupling of content and style. Concurrently, we employ multiple cascading style fusion modules that utilize point-wise instance normalization to progressively recombine content and style features, which enhances cross-modal alignment and structural consistency. Experiments conducted on the private MSKT and public KiTS19 datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed PSTUDA over comparative methods in multi-sequence kidney and tumor segmentation. The average Dice Similarity Coefficients are increased by at least 1.8% and 3.9%, respectively. Impressively, our PSTUDA not only significantly reduces the floating-point computation by approximately 72% but also reduces the number of model parameters by about 50%, bringing higher efficiency and feasibility to practical clinical applications.",2024-12-16,1,NeurIPS

A primary challenge lies in generating accurate and style-consistent textual and visual content. Existing works in a related task of visual text generation often focus on generating text within given specific regions, which limits the creativity of generation models, resulting in style or color inconsistencies between textual and visual elements if applied to design image generation. To address this issue, we propose an end-to-end, one-stage diffusion-based framework that avoids intricate components like position and layout modeling. Specifically, the proposed framework directly synthesizes textual and visual design elements from user prompts. It utilizes a distinctive character embedding derived from the visual text to enhance the input prompt, along with a character localization loss for enhanced supervision during text generation. Furthermore, we employ a self-play Direct Preference Optimization fine-tuning strategy to improve the quality and accuracy of the synthesized visual text.

Existing methods for fine-tuning LLM-as-a-judge use cross-entropy (CE) loss, which neglects the numeric nature of score prediction. Recent work addresses numerical prediction limitations of LLM fine-tuning through regression-aware fine-tuning but does not consider chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning for score prediction. In this paper, we introduce TRACT (Two-stage Regression-Aware fine-tuning with CoT), which combines CoT reasoning with regression-aware training. TRACT uses a two-stage process: first, it fine-tunes the seed LLM to generate CoTs, which serve as the training data for the second stage; next, it uses these self-generated CoTs to retrain the seed LLM. The fine-tuning objective of TRACT applies CE loss for CoT reasoning and regression-aware loss for the score.

At the core of our work is MegaSynth, a procedurally generated 3D dataset comprising 700K scenes - over 50 times larger than the prior real dataset DL3DV - dramatically scaling the training data. To enable scalable data generation, our key idea is eliminating semantic information, removing the need to model complex semantic priors such as object affordances and scene composition. Instead, we model scenes with basic spatial structures and geometry primitives, offering scalability. Besides, we control data complexity to facilitate training while loosely aligning it with real-world data distribution to benefit real-world generalization. We explore training LRMs with both MegaSynth and available real data. Experiment results show that joint training or pre-training with MegaSynth improves reconstruction quality by 1.2 to 1.8 dB PSNR across diverse image domains. Moreover, models trained solely on MegaSynth perform comparably to those trained on real data, underscoring the low-level nature of 3D reconstruction.

These cues capture diverse facets of temporal evolution and make distinct contributions across various modules in the VisionOcc framework. To effectively fuse temporal signals across heterogeneous representations, we propose a novel fusion strategy by reinterpreting the formulation of vanilla RNNs.

We eliminate nearly all the computations of the transformer model except for the necessary computation required by the multi-head attention operation. This is made possible by utilizing an alternative method for feature transformation to replace the linear projection of fully-connected layers. Specifically, we first construct a group of in-memory lookup tables that store a large amount of discrete vectors to replace the weight matrix used in linear projection. We then use a hash algorithm to retrieve a correlated subset of vectors dynamically based on the input embedding. The retrieved vectors combined together will form the output embedding, which provides an estimation of the result of matrix multiplication operation in a fully-connected layer. Compared to conducting matrix multiplication, retrieving data blocks from memory is a much cheaper operation which requires little computations.

Test-time adaptation (TTA) has emerged as a promising approach to enhance VLM performance under such conditions. In practice, test data often arrives in batches, leading to increasing interest in the transductive TTA setting. However, existing TTA methods primarily focus on individual test samples, overlooking crucial cross-sample correlations within a batch. While recent ViT-based TTA methods have introduced batch-level adaptation, they remain suboptimal for VLMs due to inadequate integration of the text modality. To address these limitations, we propose a novel transductive TTA framework, Supportive Clique-based Attribute Prompting (SCAP), which effectively combines visual and textual information to enhance adaptation by generating fine-grained attribute prompts across test batches. SCAP first forms supportive cliques of test samples in an unsupervised manner based on visual similarity and learns an attribute prompt for each clique, capturing shared attributes critical for adaptation. For each test sample, SCAP aggregates attribute prompts from its associated cliques, providing enriched contextual information. To ensure adaptability over time, we incorporate a retention module that dynamically updates attribute prompts and their associated attributes as new data arrives. Comprehensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that SCAP outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, significantly advancing VLM generalization under domain shifts.

However, they often result in suboptimal zero-shot performance.This study develops an event encoder without relying on additional reconstruction networks. We theoretically analyze the performance bottlenecks of previous approaches: the embedding optimization objectives are prone to suffer from the spatial sparsity of event data, causing semantic misalignments between the learned event embedding space and the CLIP text embedding space. To mitigate the issue, we explore a scalar-wise modulation strategy. Furthermore, to scale up the number of events and RGB data pairs for training, we also study a pipeline for synthesizing event data from static RGB images in mass.Experimentally, we demonstrate an attractive scaling property in the number of parameters and synthesized data.

A persistent challenge is that a better teacher does not always yield a better student, to which a common mitigation is to use additional supervision from several “intermediate” teachers. One empirically validated variant of this principle is progressive distillation, where the student learns from successive intermediate checkpoints of the teacher. Using sparse parity as a sandbox, we identify an implicit curriculum as one mechanism through which progressive distillation accelerates the student’s learning. This curriculum is available only through the intermediate checkpoints but not the final converged one, and imparts both empirical acceleration and a provable sample complexity benefit to the student. We then extend our investigation to Transformers trained on probabilistic context-free grammars (PCFGs) and real-world pre-training datasets (Wikipedia and Books).

Similar to conventional artificial neural networks (ANNs), SNNs are also vulnerable to gradient-based adversarial attacks, wherein gradients are calculated by spatial-temporal back-propagation (STBP) and surrogate gradients (SGs). However, the SGs may be invisible for an inference-only model as they do not influence the inference results, and current gradient-based attacks are ineffective for binary dynamic images captured by the dynamic vision sensor (DVS). While some approaches addressed the issue of invisible SGs through universal SGs, their SGs lack a correlation with the victim model, resulting in sub-optimal performance. Moreover, the imperceptibility of existing SNN-based binary attacks is still insufficient. In this paper, we introduce an innovative potential-dependent surrogate gradient (PDSG) method to establish a robust connection between the SG and the model, thereby enhancing the adaptability of adversarial attacks across various models with invisible SGs.

The resulting model accurately accounts for direct and indirect light transport effects and, when applied to captured measurements from a flash lidar system, enables state-of-the-art 3D reconstruction in the presence of strong indirect light. Further, we demonstrate view synthesis of propagating light, automatic decomposition of captured measurements into direct and indirect components, as well as novel capabilities such as multi-view time-resolved relighting of captured scenes.",2025-06-01,1,CVPR

However, generating 3DGS remains challenging due to their discrete, unstructured, and permutation-invariant nature. In this work, we present a simple yet effective method to overcome these challenges. We utilize spherical mapping to transform 3DGS into a structured 2D representation, termed UVGS. UVGS can be viewed as multi-channel images, with feature dimensions as a concatenation of Gaussian attributes such as position, scale, color, opacity, and rotation. We further find that these heterogeneous features can be compressed into a lower-dimensional (e.g., 3-channel) shared feature space using a carefully designed multi-branch network. The compressed UVGS can be treated as typical RGB images. Remarkably, we discover that typical VAEs trained with latent diffusion models can directly generalize to this new representation without additional training. Our novel representation makes it effortless to leverage foundational 2D models, such as diffusion models, to directly model 3DGS. Additionally, one can simply increase the 2D UV resolution to accommodate more Gaussians, making UVGS a scalable solution compared to typical 3D backbones. This approach immediately unlocks various novel generation applications of 3DGS by inherently utilizing the already developed superior 2D generation capabilities. In our experiments, we demonstrate various unconditional, conditional generation, and inpainting applications of 3DGS based on diffusion models, which were previously non-trivial.",2025-06-01,3,CVPR

However, the methods adopting this technique typically lack equivariance, which is crucial for effective 3D learning. Equivariance serves as a valuable inductive prior, aiding in the generation of robust multi-view features for 3D scene understanding. In this paper, we explore the application of equivariant multi-view learning to depth estimation, not only recognizing its significance for computer vision and robotics but also addressing the limitations of previous research. Most prior studies have either overlooked equivariance in this setting or achieved only approximate equivariance through data augmentation, which often leads to inconsistencies across different reference frames. To address this issue, we propose to embed $SE(3)$ equivariance into the Perceiver IO architecture. We employ Spherical Harmonics for positional encoding to ensure 3D rotation equivariance, and develop a specialized equivariant encoder and decoder within the Perceiver IO architecture. To validate our model, we applied it to the task of stereo depth estimation, achieving state of the art results on real-world datasets without explicit geometric constraints or extensive data augmentation.",2024-12-16,4,NeurIPS

Wong, Kwun Chuen Gary Chan","While several recent matrix completion methods are developed to deal with non-uniform observation probabilities across matrix entries, very few allow the missingness to depend on the mostly unobserved matrix measurements, which is generally ill-posed. We aim to tackle a subclass of these ill-posed settings, characterized by a flexible separable observation probability assumption that can depend on the matrix measurements. We propose a regularized pairwise pseudo-likelihood approach for matrix completion and prove that the proposed estimator can asymptotically recover the low-rank parameter matrix up to an identifiable equivalence class of a constant shift and scaling, at a near-optimal asymptotic convergence rate of the standard well-posed (non-informative missing) setting, while effectively mitigating the impact of informative missingness.

Yet, their effectiveness in practical applications is compromised by domain shifts and distributional changes, especially when test data distributions diverge from training data. Therefore, the paradigm of test-time adaptation (TTA) has emerged, enabling the use of online off-the-shelf data at test time, supporting independent sample predictions, and eliminating reliance on test annotations. Traditional TTA methods, however, often rely on costly training or optimization processes, or make unrealistic assumptions about accessing or storing historical training and test data. Instead, this study proposes FreeTTA, a training-free and universally available method that makes no assumptions, to enhance the flexibility of TTA. More importantly, FreeTTA is the first to explicitly model the test data distribution, enabling the use of intrinsic relationships among test samples to enhance predictions of individual samples without simultaneous access--a direction not previously explored. FreeTTA achieves these advantages by introducing an online EM algorithm that utilizes zero-shot predictions from VLMs as priors to iteratively compute the posterior probabilities of each online test sample and update parameters. Experiments demonstrate that FreeTTA achieves stable and significant improvements compared to state-of-the-art methods across 15 datasets in both cross-domain and out-of-distribution settings.",2025-06-01,3,CVPR

Inspired by weak-to-strong generalization, where a strong LM fine-tuned on labels generated by a weaker model can consistently outperform its weak supervisor, we extend this idea to model alignment. In this work, we observe that the alignment behavior in weaker models can be effectively transferred to stronger models and even exhibit an amplification effect. Based on this insight, we propose a method called Weak-to-Strong Preference Optimization (WSPO), which achieves strong model alignment by learning the distribution differences before and after the alignment of the weak model. Experiments demonstrate that WSPO delivers outstanding performance, improving the win rate of Qwen2-7B-Instruct on Arena-Hard from 39.70 to 49.60, achieving a remarkable 47.04 length-controlled win rate on AlpacaEval 2, and scoring 7.33 on MT-bench.

LAST scores are evaluated using the $\mathcal{H}_{\infty}$ norms of subsystems and layer-wise energy normalization. The scores serve as global pruning criteria, enabling cross-layer comparison of states and layer-adaptive pruning. Across various sequence benchmarks, LAST optimizes previous SSMs, revealing the redundancy and compressibility of their state spaces. Notably, we demonstrate that, on average, pruning 33\% of states still maintains performance with 0.52\% accuracy loss in multi-input multi-output SSMs without retraining.

Our benchmark annotates the underlying commonsense and discourse constraints in visual narrative samples, offering systematic scaffolds for learning the implicit strategies of visual storytelling. Based on the incorporated narrative constraints, we further propose novel metrics to closely evaluate the consistency of generated narrative images and the alignment of generations with the input textual narrative.

However, when the visual input changes from a single image to a long video, the above paradigm encounters difficulty because the vast amount of video tokens has significantly exceeded the maximal capacity of MLLMs. Therefore, existing video-based MLLMs are mostly established upon sampling a small portion of tokens from input data, which can cause key information to be lost and thus produce incorrect answers. This paper presents a simple yet effective algorithm named Adaptive Keyframe Sampling (AKS). It inserts a plug-and-play module known as keyframe selection, which aims to maximize the useful information with a fixed number of video tokens. We formulate keyframe selection as an optimization involving (1) the relevance between the keyframes and the prompt, and (2) the coverage of the keyframes over the video, and present an adaptive algorithm to approximate the best solution. Experiments on two long video understanding benchmarks validate that Adaptive Keyframe Sampling improves video QA accuracy (beyond strong baselines) upon selecting informative keyframes.

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses this issue by incorporating external, real-time information retrieval to ground LLM responses.

To tackle this problem, we propose Multi-Agent Filtering Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MAIN-RAG), a training-free RAG framework that leverages multiple LLM agents to collaboratively filter and score retrieved documents. Specifically, MAIN-RAG introduces an adaptive filtering mechanism that dynamically adjusts the relevance filtering threshold based on score distributions, effectively minimizing noise while maintaining high recall of relevant documents. The proposed approach leverages inter-agent consensus to ensure robust document selection without requiring additional training data or fine-tuning. Experimental results across four QA benchmarks demonstrate that MAIN-RAG consistently outperforms traditional RAG approaches, achieving a 2–11% improvement in answer accuracy while reducing the number of irrelevant retrieved documents. Quantitative analysis further reveals that our approach achieves superior response consistency and answer accuracy over baseline methods, offering a competitive and practical alternative to training-based solutions.",2025-07-01,10,ACL

State-of-the-art unsupervised methods use self-supervised pre-trained models to obtain pseudo-labels which are used in training a prompt-based segmentation model.

We interpret the self-attention tensor as a Markov transition operator, which enables us to iteratively construct a Markov chain. Pixel-wise counting of the required number of iterations along the Markov chain to reach a relative probability threshold yields a Markov-iteration-map, which we simply call a Markov-map. Compared to the raw attention maps, we show that our proposed Markov-map has less noise, sharper semantic boundaries and more uniform values within semantically similar regions. We integrate the Markov-map in a simple yet effective truncated nearest neighbor framework to obtain interactive point prompt based segmentation.

Then, we improved the honesty and helpfulness of LLMs in both training-free and fine-tuning settings. Specifically, we propose a training-free method named Curiosity-Driven Prompting, which enables LLMs to express their internal confusion and uncertainty about the given query and then optimize their responses. Moreover, we also propose a two-stage fine-tuning approach, inspired by curriculum learning, to enhance the honesty and helpfulness of LLMs. The method first teaches LLMs to distinguish between honest and dishonest, and then LLMs are trained to learn to respond more helpfully.

However, in this paper, we find that there naturally exists a gap, which resembles the modality gap, between the prototype and image instance embeddings extracted from the frozen pre-trained backbone, and simply applying the same transformation during the adaptation phase constrains exploring the optimal representation distributions and shrinks the gap between prototype and image representations. To solve this problem, we propose a simple yet effective method,contrastive prototype-image adaptation(CoPA), to adapt different transformations for prototypes and images similarly to CLIP by treating prototypes as text prompts.

To circumvent the issue, we propose a simple and effective approach called Local Perplexity Ranking (LPR), which replaces the ""noisy"" candidates with their nearest neighbors that are more likely to be clean. Our method is motivated by analyzing the perplexity deviation caused by noisy labels and decomposing perplexity into inherent perplexity and matching perplexity. Our key idea behind LPR is thus to decouple the matching perplexity by performing the ranking among the neighbors in semantic space.

To address these two problems above, we propose a scalable and reliable Semantic-level Evaluation framework for Open domain Event detection (SEOE) by constructing a more representative evaluation benchmark and introducing a semantic evaluation metric. Specifically, our proposed framework first constructs a scalable evaluation benchmark that currently includes 564 event types covering 7 major domains, with a cost-effective supplementary annotation strategy to ensure the benchmark’s representativeness. The strategy also allows for the supplement of new event types and domains in the future. Then, the proposed SEOE leverages large language models (LLMs) as automatic evaluation agents to compute a semantic F1-score, incorporating fine-grained definitions of semantically similar labels to enhance the reliability of the evaluation. Extensive experiments validate the representatives of the benchmark and the reliability of the semantic evaluation metric. Existing ODED methods are thoroughly evaluated, and the error patterns of predictions are analyzed, revealing several insightful findings.",2025-07-01,1,ACL

Unlike existing methods that require extensive weight retraining for each target bitrate, we hypothesize that variable-rate coding can be achieved by adjusting quantization parameters (QPs) of pre-trained weights. Our study reveals that traditional quantization methods, which assume inter-layer independence, are ineffective for non-generalized INR-VC models due to significant dependencies across layers. To address this, we redefine variable-rate INR-VC as a mixed-precision quantization problem and establish a theoretical framework for sensitivity criteria aimed at simplified, fine-grained rate control. Additionally, we propose network-wise calibration and channel-wise quantization strategies to minimize quantization-induced errors, arriving at a unified formula for representation-oriented PTQ calibration. Our experimental evaluations demonstrate that NeuroQuant significantly outperforms existing techniques in varying bitwidth quantization and compression efficiency, accelerating encoding by up to eight times and enabling quantization down to INT2 with minimal reconstruction loss. This work introduces variable-rate INR-VC for the first time and lays a theoretical foundation for future research in rate-distortion optimization, advancing the field of video coding technology.

To tackle this problem, we proposeposition coupling, a simple yet effective method that directly embeds the structure of the tasks into the positional encoding of a (decoder-only) Transformer. Taking a departure from the vanilla absolute position mechanism assigning unique position IDs to each of the tokens, we assign the same position IDs to two or more ""relevant"" tokens; for integer addition tasks, we regard digits of the same significance as in the same position. On the empirical side, we show that with the proposed position coupling, our models trained on 1 to 30-digit additions can generalize up to200-digitadditions (6.67x of the trained length). On the theoretical side, we prove that a 1-layer Transformer with coupled positions can solve the addition task involving exponentially many digits, whereas any 1-layer Transformer without positional information cannot entirely solve it. We also demonstrate that position coupling can be applied to other algorithmic tasks such as Nx2 multiplication and a two-dimensional task.

Compared to supervised methods, self-supervised methods rely more on the prior embedded in deep networks themselves. As a result, most of the self-supervised methods are designed with Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs) architectures, which well capture one of the most important image prior, translation equivariant prior. Inspired by the great success achieved by the introduction of translational equivariance, in this paper, we explore the way to further incorporate another important image prior. Specifically, we first apply high-accuracy rotation equivariant convolution to self-supervised image denoising. Through rigorous theoretical analysis, we have proved that simply replacing all the convolution layers with rotation equivariant convolution layers would modify the network into its rotation equivariant version. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that rotation equivariant image prior is introduced to self-supervised image denoising at the network architecture level with a comprehensive theoretical analysis of equivariance errors, which offers a new perspective to the field of self-supervised image denoising. Moreover, to further improve the performance, we design a new mask mechanism to fusion the output of rotation equivariant network and vanilla CNN-based network, and construct an adaptive rotation equivariant framework.

Recent learning-based demonstration selection methods have proven beneficial to ICL by choosing more useful exemplars. While these methods generally assume they learn better similarity measurements between exemplars and test cases from the proxy task, what kinds of similarities are captured by them and are vital to performing ICL still need to be explored. To dive into this question, we analyze the working mechanism of learning-based demonstration selection methods and empirically identify two essential factors of their similarity measurements: 1) Integrating task-agnostic similarities of different levels between the input of exemplars and test cases; 2) Incorporating task-specific similarity between the output of exemplars and test cases. We validate these two findings through extensive quantitative analysis across ten datasets and various LLMs. Based on these insights, we introduce two simplified exemplar selection methods, MLSM and TTF, catering to task-agnostic and task-specific demands to eliminate costly data collection.

However, existing models still struggle to capture the perceptual alignment between varying speech characteristics and corresponding lip movements. In this work, we claim that three criteria -- Temporal Synchronization, Lip Readability, and Expressiveness -- are crucial for achieving perceptually accurate lip movements. Motivated by our hypothesis that a desirable representation space exists to meet these three criteria, we introduce a speech-mesh synchronized representation that captures intricate correspondences between speech signals and 3D face meshes. We found that our learned representation exhibits desirable characteristics, and we plug it into existing models as a perceptual loss to better align lip movements to the given speech. In addition, we utilize this representation as a perceptual metric and introduce two other physically grounded lip synchronization metrics to assess how well the generated 3D talking heads align with these three criteria.

Existing approaches often rely on the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) LoRA framework to preserve previous instruction alignments. However, these methods are prone to Catastrophic Forgetting (CF), as they aggregate all LoRA blocks via simple summation, which compromises performance over time. In this paper, we identify a critical parameter inefficiency in the MoELoRA framework within the MCIT context. Based on this insight, we propose BranchLoRA, an asymmetric framework to enhance both efficiency and performance. To mitigate CF, we introduce a flexible tuning-freezing mechanism within BranchLoRA, enabling branches to specialize in intra-task knowledge while fostering inter-task collaboration. Moreover, we incrementally incorporate task-specific routers to ensure an optimal branch distribution over time, rather than favoring the most recent task. To streamline inference, we introduce a task selector that automatically routes test inputs to the appropriate router without requiring task identity.

However, these models can create unrealistic inpainted images due to two main issues: (1) Unwanted object insertion: Even with unmasked areas as context, generative models may still generate arbitrary objects in the masked region that don't align with the rest of the image. (2) Color inconsistency: Inpainted regions often have color shifts that causes a smeared appearance, reducing image quality. Retraining the generative model could help solve these issues, but it's costly since state-of-the-art latent-based diffusion and rectified flow models require a three-stage training process: training a VAE, training a generative U-Net or transformer, and fine-tuning for inpainting. Instead, this paper proposes a post-processing approach, dubbed as ASUKA (Aligned Stable inpainting with UnKnown Areas prior), to improve inpainting models. To address unwanted object insertion, we leverage a Masked Auto-Encoder (MAE) for reconstruction-based priors. This mitigates object hallucination while maintaining the model's generation capabilities. To address color inconsistency, we propose a specialized VAE decoder that treats latent-to-image decoding as a local harmonization task, significantly reducing color shifts for color-consistent inpainting. We validate ASUKA on SD 1.5 and FLUX inpainting variants with Places2 and MISATO, our proposed diverse collection of datasets. Results show that ASUKA mitigates object hallucination and improves color consistency over standard diffusion and rectified flow models and other inpainting methods.",2025-06-01,3,CVPR

In this paper, we study task vectors at the layer level, focusing on task layer matrices and their singular value decomposition. In particular, we concentrate on the resulting singular vectors, which we refer to as Task Singular Vectors (TSV). Recognizing that layer task matrices are often low-rank, we propose TSV-Compress (TSV-C), a simple procedure that compresses them to 10% of their original size while retaining 99% of accuracy.

We build upon the Segment-Anything 2 (SAM2) model, that provides robust segmentation and tracking capabilities and is naturally suited for streaming processing. We make SAM2 wiser, by empowering it with natural language understanding and explicit temporal modeling at the feature extraction stage, without fine-tuning its weights, and without outsourcing modality interaction to external models. To this end, we introduce a novel adapter module that injects temporal information and multi-modal cues in the feature extraction process. We further reveal the phenomenon of tracking bias in SAM2 and propose a learnable module to adjust its tracking focus when the current frame features suggest a new object more aligned with the caption.

LAIF first performs supervised fine-tuning (SFT) using demonstrations from a teacher model and then further fine-tunes the model with reinforcement learning (RL) or direct preference optimization (DPO), using feedback from a critic model. While recent popular open-source models have demonstrated substantial improvements in performance from the RL step, in this paper we question whether the complexity of this RL step is truly warranted for AI feedback. We show that the improvements of the RL step are virtually entirely due to the widespread practice of using a weaker teacher model (e.g. GPT-3.5) for SFT data collection than the critic (e.g., GPT-4) used for AI feedback generation. Specifically, we show that simple supervised fine-tuning with GPT-4 as the teacher outperforms existing LAIF pipelines. More generally, we find that the gains from LAIF vary substantially across base model families, test-time evaluation protocols, and critic models. Finally, we provide a mechanistic explanation for when SFT may outperform the full two-step LAIF pipeline as well as suggestions for making LAIF maximally useful in practice.",2024-12-16,32,NeurIPS

Given a partially-trained model and its initial SFT checkpoint, ExPO improves the implicit optimization objective of alignment training by simply amplifying the parameter change based on a first-order approximation, without any additional training overhead. Through controlled experiments, we demonstrate that ExPO boosts a DPO model trained with only 20% steps to outperform the fully-trained one.

To address this challenge, we propose a new framework called Track Any Anomalous Object (TAO), which introduces a granular video anomaly detection pipeline that, for the first time, integrates the detection of multiple fine-grained anomalous objects into a unified framework. Unlike methods that assign anomaly scores to every pixel, our approach transforms the problem into pixel-level tracking of anomalous objects.

This connection is facilitated via tunable V-L and L-V adapters that enable close Vision-Language (VL) alignment. The architecture is trained to synchronize both spatial and temporal elements of video content with textual instructions.

Recently, the remarkable zero-shot capabilities of the large pre-trained vision-language model (e.g., CLIP) have made it popular for various downstream tasks. However, the effectiveness of this capacity often degrades when there are shifts in data distribution during testing compared to the training data. In this paper, we propose a novel method, known as CLIPCEIL, a model that utilizes Channel rEfinement and Image-text aLignment to facilitate the CLIP to the inaccessible $\textit{out-of-distribution}$ test datasets that exhibit domain shifts. Specifically, we refine the feature channels in the visual domain to ensure they contain domain-invariant and class-relevant features by using a lightweight adapter. This is achieved by minimizing the inter-domain variance while maximizing the inter-class variance. In the meantime, we ensure the image-text alignment by aligning text embeddings of the class descriptions and their corresponding image embedding while further removing the domain-specific features.

Recent studies have employed an auxiliary encoder to identify a corresponding representation from data and to adjust the dimensionality of a latent variable $\mathbf{z}$. Meanwhile, this auxiliary structure invokes an *information split problem*; the information of each data instance $\mathbf{x}_0$ is divided into diffusion endpoint $\mathbf{x}_T$ and encoded $\mathbf{z}$ because there exist two inference paths starting from the data. The latent variable modeled by diffusion endpoint $\mathbf{x}_T$ has some disadvantages. The diffusion endpoint $\mathbf{x}_T$ is computationally expensive to obtain and inflexible in dimensionality. To address this problem, we introduce Diffusion Bridge AuteEncoders (DBAE), which enables $\mathbf{z}$-dependent endpoint $\mathbf{x}_T$ inference through a feed-forward architecture. This structure creates an information bottleneck at $\mathbf{z}$, so $\mathbf{x}_T$ becomes dependent on $\mathbf{z}$ in its generation. This results in $\mathbf{z}$ holding the full information of data. We propose an objective function for DBAE to enable both reconstruction and generative modeling, with their theoretical justification. Empirical evidence supports the effectiveness of the intended design in DBAE, which notably enhances downstream inference quality, reconstruction, and disentanglement.

Unlike approaches that extend or search for rationales, DeAR is featured by 1) adopting a tree-based question decomposition manner to plan the organization of rationales, which mimics the logical planning inherentin human cognition; 2) globally updating the rationales at each reasoning step through natural language feedback. Specifically, theDecomposestage decomposes the question into simpler sub-questions, storing them as new nodes; theAnalyzestage generates and self-checks rationales for sub-questions at each node evel; and theRethinkstage updates parent-node rationales based on feedback from their child nodes. By generating and updating the reasoning process from a more global perspective, DeAR constructs more adaptive and accurate logical structures for complex problems, facilitating timely error correction compared to rationale-extension and search-based approaches such as Tree-of-Thoughts (ToT) and Graph-of-Thoughts (GoT). We conduct extensive experiments on three reasoning benchmarks, including ScienceQA, StrategyQA, and GSM8K, which cover a variety of reasoning tasks, demonstrating that our approach significantly reduces logical errors and enhances performance across various LLMs. Furthermore, we validate that DeAR is an efficient method that achieves a superior trade-off between accuracy and reasoning time compared to ToT and GoT.",2024-12-16,22,NeurIPS

Existing approaches typically treat image fusion and subsequent high-level tasks as separate processes, resulting in fused images that offer only marginal gains in task performance and fail to provide constructive feedback for optimizing the fusion process. To overcome these limitations, we propose a Discriminative Cross-Dimension Evolutionary Learning Framework, termed DCEvo, which simultaneously enhances visual quality and perception accuracy. Leveraging the robust search capabilities of Evolutionary Learning, our approach formulates the optimization of dual tasks as a multi-objective problem by employing an Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) to dynamically balance loss function parameters. Inspired by visual neuroscience, we integrate a Discriminative Enhancer (DE) within both the encoder and decoder, enabling the effective learning of complementary features from different modalities. Additionally, our Cross-Dimensional Embedding (CDE) block facilitates mutual enhancement between high-dimensional task features and low-dimensional fusion features, ensuring a cohesive and efficient feature integration process. Experimental results on three benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving an average improvement of 9.32% in visual quality while also enhancing subsequent high-level tasks.

We propose a novel approach for moving object segmentation that combines long-range trajectory motion cues with DINO-based semantic features and leverages SAM2 for pixel-level mask densification through an iterative prompting strategy.

However, recent studies have overemphasized co-occurrence relationships among labels, which can lead to overfitting risk on this overemphasis, resulting in suboptimal models. To tackle this problem, we advocate for balancing correlative and discriminative relationships among labels to mitigate the risk of overfitting and enhance model performance. To this end, we propose the Multi-Label Visual Prompt Tuning framework, a novel and parameter-efficient method that groups classes into multiple class subsets according to label co-occurrence and mutual exclusivity relationships, and then models them respectively to balance the two relationships. In this work, since each group contains multiple classes, multiple prompt tokens are adopted within Vision Transformer (ViT) to capture the correlation or discriminative label relationship within each group, and effectively learn correlation or discriminative representations for class subsets. On the other hand, each group contains multiple group-aware visual representations that may correspond to multiple classes, and the mixture of experts (MoE) model can cleverly assign them from the group-aware to the label-aware, adaptively obtaining label-aware representation, which is more conducive to classification.

We first build hierarchical features and label fields for each object state using 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) by distilling mask features and view-consistent labels from multi-view images. We then perform object- and part-level queries on the 3D Gaussian primitives to identify static and articulated elements, estimating global transformations and local articulation parameters along with affordances. Finally, scenes from different states are merged and refined based on the estimated transformations, enabling robust affordance-based interaction and manipulation of objects.

While these tasks have traditionally been modeled separately, we argue that they can benefit from joint learning in a multi-task framework. To this end, we propose WeakMCN, a novel multi-task collaborative network that effectively combines WREC and WRES with a dual-branch architecture. Specifically, the WREC branch is formulated as anchor-based contrastive learning, which also acts as a teacher to supervise the WRES branch. In WeakMCN, we propose two innovative designs to facilitate multi-task collaboration, namely Dynamic Visual Feature Enhancement(DVFE) and Collaborative Consistency Module(CCM). DVFE dynamically combines various pre-trained visual knowledge to meet different task requirements, while CCM promotes cross-task consistency from the perspective of optimization. Extensive experimental results on three popular REC and RES benchmarks, i.e., RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, and RefCOCOg, consistently demonstrate performance gains of WeakMCN over state-of-the-art single-task alternatives, e.g., up to 3.91% and 13.11% on RefCOCO for WREC and WRES tasks, respectively. Furthermore, experiments also validate the strong generalization ability of WeakMCN in both semi-supervised REC and RES settings against existing methods, e.g., +8.94% for semi-REC and +7.71% for semi-RES on 1% RefCOCO.

Current evaluation tasks like VQA and visual grounding remain too coarse to assess fine-grained pixel comprehension accurately. Though segmentation is foundational for pixel-level understanding, existing methods often require MLLMs to generate implicit tokens, decoded through external pixel decoders. This approach disrupts the MLLM's text output space, potentially compromising language capabilities and reducing flexibility and extensibility, while failing to reflect the model's intrinsic pixel-level understanding.Thus, we introduce the Human-Like Mask Annotation Task (HLMAT), a new paradigm where MLLMs mimic human annotators using interactive segmentation tools. Modeling segmentation as a multi-step Markov Decision Process, HLMAT enables MLLMs to iteratively generate text-based click points, achieving high-quality masks without architectural changes or implicit tokens. Through this setup, we develop SegAgent, a model fine-tuned on human-like annotation trajectories, which achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods and supports additional tasks like mask refinement and annotation filtering.HLMAT provides a protocol for assessing fine-grained pixel understanding in MLLMs and introduces a vision-centric, multi-step decision-making task that facilitates exploration of MLLMs' visual reasoning abilities.

Many MDE models aim to predict affine-invariant relative depth from monocular images, while recent developments in large-scale training and vision foundation models enable reasonable estimation of metric (absolute) depth. However, effectively leveraging these predictions for geometric vision tasks, in particular relative pose estimation, remains relatively under explored. While depths provide rich constraints for cross-view image alignment, the intrinsic noise and ambiguity from the monocular depth priors present practical challenges to improving upon classic keypoint-based solutions. In this paper, we develop three solvers for relative pose estimation that explicitly account for independent affine (scale and shift) ambiguities, covering both calibrated and uncalibrated conditions. We further propose a hybrid estimation pipeline that combines our proposed solvers with classic point-based solvers and epipolar constraints. We find that the affine correction modeling is beneficial to not only the relative depth priors but also, surprisingly, the ""metric"" ones. Results across multiple datasets demonstrate large improvements of our approach over classic keypoint-based baselines and PnP-based solutions, under both calibrated and uncalibrated setups. We also show that our method improves consistently with different feature matchers and MDE models, and can further benefit from very recent advances on both modules.

Our analysis reveals that alignment techniques, though intended to enhance helpfulness, can inadvertently impair models’ reflective judgment–the ability to override default behaviors when faced with invalid options. We additionally conduct a parallel human study showing similar instruction-following biases, with implications for how these biases may propagate through human feedback datasets used in alignment. We provide extensive ablation studies examining the impact of model size, training techniques, and prompt engineering.

We introduce a unified 3D generation framework, named Ouroboros3D, which integrates diffusion-based multi-view image generation and 3D reconstruction into a recursive diffusion process. In our framework, these two modules are jointly trained through a self-conditioning mechanism, allowing them to adapt to each other's characteristics for robust inference.

However, place cells also respond to contextual cues, such as smell. Furthermore, they have the ability to remap, wherein the firing fields and rates of cells change in response to changes in the environment. How place cell responses emerge, and how these representations remap is not fully understood. In this work, we propose a similarity-based objective function that translates proximity in space, to proximity in representation. We show that a neural network trained to minimize the proposed objective learns place-like representations. We also show that the proposed objective is easily extended to include other sources of information, such as context information, in the same way. When trained to encode multiple contexts, networks learn distinct representations, exhibiting remapping behaviors between contexts. The proposed objective is invariant to orthogonal transformations. Such transformations of the original trained representation (e.g. rotations), therefore yield new representations distinct from the original, without explicit relearning, akin to remapping. Our findings shed new light on the formation and encoding properties of place cells, and also demonstrate an interesting case of representational reuse.",2024-12-16,4,NeurIPS

Photorealistic 3D head avatar reconstruction from such recordings is challenging due to limited observations, which leaves unobserved regions under-constrained and can lead to artifacts in novel views. To address this problem, we introduce a multi-view head diffusion model, leveraging its priors to fill in missing regions and ensure view consistency in Gaussian splatting renderings. To enable precise viewpoint control, we use normal maps rendered from FLAME-based head reconstruction, which provides pixel-aligned inductive biases. We also condition the diffusion model on VAE features extracted from the input image to preserve facial identity and appearance details. For Gaussian avatar reconstruction, we distill multi-view diffusion priors by using iteratively denoised images as pseudo-ground truths, effectively mitigating over-saturation issues. To further improve photorealism, we apply latent upsampling priors to refine the denoised latent before decoding it into an image.

During training, DynRefer stochastically aligns language descriptions of multimodal tasks with images of multiple resolutions, which are constructed by nesting a set of random views around the referred region.

Recent works often attribute such deficiency in dense predictions to the self-attention layers in the final block, and have achieved commendable results by modifying the original query-key attention to self-correlation attention, (e.g., query-query and key-key attention). However, these methods overlook the cross-correlation attention (query-key) properties, which capture the rich spatial correspondence. In this paper, we reveal that the cross-correlation of the self-attention in CLIP's non-final layers also exhibits localization properties. Therefore, we propose the Residual Cross-correlation Self-attention (RCS) module, which leverages the cross-correlation self-attention from intermediate layers to remold the attention in the final block. The RCS module effectively reorganizes spatial information, unleashing the localization potential within CLIP for dense vision-language inference.

				738-745","Reinforcement Learning has revolutionized decision-making processes in dynamic environments, yet it often struggles with autonomously detecting and achieving goals without clear feedback signals. For example, in a Source Term Estimation problem, the lack of precise environmental information makes it challenging to provide clear feedback signals and to define and evaluate how the source's location is determined. To address this challenge, the Autonomous Goal Detection and Cessation (AGDC) module was developed, enhancing various RL algorithms by incorporating a self-feedback mechanism for autonomous goal detection and cessation upon task completion. Our method effectively identifies and ceases undefined goals by approximating the agent's belief, significantly enhancing the capabilities of RL algorithms in environments with limited feedback. To validate  effectiveness of our approach, we integrated AGDC with deep Q-Network, proximal policy optimization, and deep deterministic policy gradient algorithms, and evaluated its performance on the Source Term Estimation problem. The experimental results showed that AGDC-enhanced RL algorithms significantly outperformed traditional statistical methods such as infotaxis, entrotaxis, and dual control for exploitation and exploration, as well as a non-statistical random action selection method. These improvements were evident in terms of success rate, mean traveled distance, and search time, highlighting AGDC's effectiveness and efficiency in complex, real-world scenarios.",2025-04-11,3,AAAI

Though progress has been made, their architecture or objectives are often intricate and the extendibility is limited.By contrast, with simple architecture (comprising only two unimodal encoders) and just the contrastive objective, popular pre-trained VL models (e.g., CLIP) achieve superior performance in general domains, which are further easily extended to downstream tasks.However, inheriting such benefits of CLIP in the fashion domain is non-trivial in the presence of the notable domain gap. Empirically, we find that directly finetuning on fashion data leads CLIP to frequently ignore minor yet important details such as logos and composition, which are critical in fashion tasks such as retrieval and captioning.In this work, to maintain CLIP's simple architecture and objective while explicitly attending to fashion details, we propose $E^2$: Easy Regional Contrastive Learning of Expressive Fashion Representations.$E^2$ introduces only a few selection tokens and fusion blocks (just 1.9\% additional parameters in total) with only contrastive losses. Despite lightweight, in our primary focus, cross-modal retrieval, $E^2$ notably outperforms existing fashion VLMs with various fashion-specific objectives.Moreover, thanks to CLIP's widespread use in downstream tasks in general domains (e.g., zero-shot composed image retrieval and image captioning), our model can easily extend these models  from general domain to the fashion domain with notable improvement.To conduct a comprehensive evaluation, we further collect data from Amazon Reviews to build a new dataset for cross-modal retrieval in the fashion domain.",2024-12-16,2,NeurIPS

Developing an effective and efficient algorithm that is capable of automatically generating high-quality PBR materials rather than RGB texture for 3D meshes can significantly streamline the 3D content creation. Most existing methods leverage pre-trained 2D diffusion models for multi-view image synthesis, which often leads to severe inconsistency between the generated textures and input 3D meshes. This paper presents TexGaussian, a novel method that uses octant-aligned 3D Gaussian Splatting for rapid PBR material generation. Specifically, we place each 3D Gaussian on the finest leaf node of the octree built from the input 3D mesh to render the multi-view images not only for the albedo map but also for roughness and metallic. Moreover, our model is trained in a regression manner instead of diffusion denoising, capable of generating the PBR material for a 3D mesh in a single feed-forward process.

Drawing inspiration from this spike-based computation, Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have been developed to construct event-driven models that emulate this efficiency. Despite these advances, deep SNNs continue to suffer from over-parameterization during training and inference, a stark contrast to the brain’s ability to self-organize. Furthermore, existing sparse SNNs are challenged by maintaining optimal pruning levels due to a static pruning ratio, resulting in either under or over-pruning.
In this paper, we propose a novel two-stage dynamic structure learning approach for deep SNNs, aimed at maintaining effective sparse training from scratch while optimizing compression efficiency. 
The first stage evaluates the compressibility of existing sparse subnetworks within SNNs using the PQ index, which facilitates an adaptive determination of the rewiring ratio for synaptic connections based on data compression insights. In the second stage, this rewiring ratio critically informs the dynamic synaptic connection rewiring process, including both pruning and regrowth. This approach significantly improves the exploration of sparse structures training in deep SNNs, adapting sparsity dynamically from the point view of compression efficiency.
Our experiments demonstrate that this sparse training approach not only aligns with the performance of current deep SNNs models but also significantly improves the efficiency of compressing sparse SNNs. Crucially, it preserves the advantages of initiating training with sparse models and offers a promising solution for implementing Edge AI on neuromorphic hardware.",2024-10-04,7,ICLR

Yet, conformal prediction is not reliable under poisoning attacks where adversaries manipulate both training and calibration data, which can significantly alter prediction sets in practice. As a solution, we propose reliable prediction sets (RPS): the first efficient method for constructing conformal prediction sets with provable reliability guarantees under poisoning. To ensure reliability under training poisoning, we introduce smoothed score functions that reliably aggregate predictions of classifiers trained on distinct partitions of the training data. To ensure reliability under calibration poisoning, we construct multiple prediction sets, each calibrated on distinct subsets of the calibration data. We then aggregate them into a majority prediction set, which includes a class only if it appears in a majority of the individual sets. Both proposed aggregations mitigate the influence of datapoints in the training and calibration data on the final prediction set. We experimentally validate our approach on image classification tasks, achieving strong reliability while maintaining utility and preserving coverage on clean data.

While existing ICL theories often assume structured training data resembling ICL tasks (e.g., x-y pairs for linear regression), LLMs are typically trained unsupervised on unstructured text, such as web content, which lacks clear parallels to tasks like word analogy. To address this gap, we examine what enables ICL in models trained on unstructured data, focusing on critical sequence model requirements and training data structure. We find that many ICL capabilities canemerge simply from co-occurrence of semantically related word pairs in unstructured data; word analogy completion, for example, can provably arise purely through co-occurrence modeling, using classical language models like continuous bag of words (CBOW), without needing positional information or attention mechanisms. However, positional information becomes crucial for logic reasoning tasks requiring generalization to unseen tokens. Finally, we identify two cases where ICL fails: one in logic reasoning tasks that require generalizing to new, unseen patterns, and another in analogy completion where relevant word pairs appear only in fixed training positions. These findings suggest that LLMs' ICL abilities depend heavily on the structural elements within their training data.",2024-12-16,4,NeurIPS

In this paper, instead of input space alignment, we propose a novel parameter space alignment paradigm that represents visual information as model weights. For each input image, we use a vision encoder to extract visual features, convert features into perceptual weights, and merge the perceptual weights with LLM's weights. In this way, the input of LLM does not require visual tokens, which reduces the length of the input sequence and greatly improves efficiency. Following this paradigm, we propose VLoRA with the perceptual weights generator. The perceptual weights generator is designed to convert visual features to perceptual weights with low-rank property, exhibiting a form similar to LoRA.

For a stream of length $T$ and privacy *without* expiration continual counting is possible with maximum  (over all time steps) additive error $O(\log^2(T)/\varepsilon)$ and the best known lower bound is $\Omega(\log(T)/\varepsilon)$; closing this gap is a challenging open problem.

Specifically, our algorithm achieves an additive error of $O(\log(T)/\epsilon)$ for a large set of privacy expiration functions. We also give a lower bound that shows that if $C$ is the additive error of any $\epsilon$-DP algorithm for this problem, then the product of $C$ and the privacy expiration function after $2C$ steps must be $\Omega(\log(T)/\epsilon)$. Our algorithm matches this lower bound as its additive error is $O(\log(T)/\epsilon)$, even when $g(2C) = O(1)$.Our empirical evaluation shows that we achieve a slowly growing privacy loss that has significantly smaller empirical privacy loss for large values of $d$ than a natural baseline algorithm.",2024-12-16,2,NeurIPS

This paper explores a new direction of *data-driven projections*, which use projection matrices learned from data instead of random projection matrices.Given training data of $n$-dimensional LPs, we learn an $n\times k$ projection matrix with $n > k$. When addressing a future LP instance, we reduce its dimensionality from $n$ to $k$ via the learned projection matrix, solve the resulting LP to obtain a $k$-dimensional solution, and apply the learned matrix to it to recover an $n$-dimensional solution.On the theoretical side, a natural question is: how much data is sufficient to ensure the quality of recovered solutions? We address this question based on the framework of *data-driven algorithm design*, which connects the amount of data sufficient for establishing generalization bounds to the *pseudo-dimension* of performance metrics. We obtain an $\tilde{\mathrm{O}}(nk^2)$ upper bound on the pseudo-dimension, where $\tilde{\mathrm{O}}$ compresses logarithmic factors. We also provide an $\Omega(nk)$ lower bound, implying our result is tight up to an $\tilde{\mathrm{O}}(k)$ factor.

However, fine-tuning CLIP to equip it with pixel-level prediction ability often suffers three issues: 1) high computational cost, 2) misalignment between the two inherent modalities of CLIP, and 3) degraded generalization ability on unseen categories. To address these issues, we propose H-CLIP a symmetrical parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) strategy conducted in hyperspherical space for both of the two CLIP modalities. Specifically, the PEFT strategy is achieved by a series of efficient block-diagonal learnable transformation matrices and a dual cross-relation communication module among all learnable matrices. Since the PEFT strategy is conducted symmetrically to the two CLIP modalities, the misalignment between them is mitigated. Furthermore, we apply an additional constraint to PEFT on the CLIP text encoder according to the hyperspherical energy principle, i.e., minimizing hyperspherical energy during fine-tuning preserves the intrinsic structure of the original parameter space, to prevent the destruction of the generalization ability offered by the CLIP text encoder.

However, training models to handle long contexts presents significant challenges. These include the scarcity of high-quality natural long-context data, the potential for performance degradation on short-context tasks, and the reduced training efficiency associated with attention mechanisms. In this paper, we introduce Untie the Knots (UtK), a novel data augmentation strategy employed during the continue pre-training phase, designed to efficiently enable LLMs to gain long-context capabilities without the need to modify the existing data mixture. In particular, we chunk the documents, shuffle the chunks, and create a complex and knotted structure of long texts; LLMs are then trained to untie these knots and identify relevant segments within seemingly chaotic token sequences. This approach greatly improves the model’s performance by accurately attending to relevant information in long context and the training efficiency is also largely increased. We conduct extensive experiments on models with 7B and 72B parameters, trained on 20 billion tokens, demonstrating that UtK achieves 75% and 84.5% accurracy on RULER at 128K context length, significantly outperforming other long context strategies.

We investigate the threat posed by undetectable backdoors, as defined in Goldwasser et al. [2022], in models developed by insidious external expert firms. When such backdoors exist, they allow the designer of the model to sell information on how to slightly perturb their input to change the outcome of the model. We develop a general strategy to plant backdoors to obfuscated neural networks, that satisfy the security properties of the celebrated notion of indistinguishability obfuscation. Applying obfuscation before releasing neural networks is a strategy that is well motivated to protect sensitive information of the external expert firm. Our method to plant backdoors ensures that even if the weights and architecture of the obfuscated model are accessible, the existence ofthe backdoor is still undetectable. Finally, we introduce the notion of undetectable backdoors to language models and extend our neural network backdoor attacks to such models based on the existence of steganographic functions.",2024-12-16,2,NeurIPS

Efros, Jun-Yan Zhu, Richard Zhang","The goal of data attribution for text-to-image models is to identify the training images that most influence the generation of a new image. Influence is defined such that, for a given output, if a model is retrained from scratch without the most influential images, the model would fail to reproduce the same output. Unfortunately, directly searching for these influential images is computationally infeasible, since it would require repeatedly retraining models from scratch. In our work, we propose an efficient data attribution method by simulating unlearning the synthesized image. We achieve this by increasing the training loss on the output image, without catastrophic forgetting of other, unrelated concepts. We then identify training images with significant loss deviations after the unlearning process and label these as influential. We evaluate our method with a computationally intensive but ""gold-standard"" retraining from scratch and demonstrate our method's advantages over previous methods.",2024-12-16,7,NeurIPS

However, recent work has noted that many positive research results studying this paradigm only consider in-distribution tasks, and may not apply to settings where there is distribution shift between the pretraining and finetuning data---a scenario that is likely when finetuning private tasks due to the sensitive nature of the data. In this work, we show empirically across three tasks that even in settings with large distribution shift, where both zero-shot performance from public data and training from scratch with private data give unusably weak results, public features can in fact improve private training accuracy by up to 67\% over private training from scratch. We provide a theoretical explanation for this phenomenon, showing that if the public and private data share a low-dimensional representation, public representations can improve the sample complexity of private training even if it is \emph{impossible} to learn the private task from the public data alone. Altogether, our results provide evidence that public data can indeed make private training practical in realistic settings of extreme distribution shift.",2024-12-16,4,NeurIPS

By caching a small number of reference image features from a subset of layers and a single timestep of the pretrained diffusion denoiser, DreamCache enables dynamic modulation of the generated image features through lightweight, trained conditioning adapters.

Current parameterization methods achieve enhanced performance under extremely high compression ratio by optimizing determined synthetic dataset in informative feature domain. However, they limit themselves to a fixed optimization space for distillation, neglecting the diverse guidance across different informative latent spaces. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel parameterization method dubbed Hierarchical Parameterization Distillation (H-PD), to systematically explore hierarchical feature within provided feature space (e.g., layers within pre-trained generative adversarial networks). We verify the correctness of our insights by applying the hierarchical optimization strategy on GAN-based parameterization method. In addition, we introduce a novel class-relevant feature distance metric to alleviate the computational burden associated with synthetic dataset evaluation, bridging the gap between synthetic and original datasets.

Although remarkable progress has been made in video generation models, generative inbetweening still faces challenges in maintaining temporal stability due to the ambiguous interpolation path between two key frames. This issue becomes particularly severe when there is a large motion gap between input frames. In this paper, we propose a straightforward yet highly effective Frame-wise Conditions-driven Video Generation (FCVG) method that significantly enhances the temporal stability of interpolated video frames. Specifically, our FCVG provides an explicit condition for each frame, making it much easier to identify the interpolation path between two input frames and thus ensuring temporally stable production of visually plausible video frames. To achieve this, we suggest extracting matched lines from two input frames that can then be easily interpolated frame by frame, serving as frame-wise conditions seamlessly integrated into existing video generation models. In extensive evaluations covering diverse scenarios such as natural landscapes, complex human poses, camera movements and animations, existing methods often exhibit incoherent transitions across frames. In contrast, our FCVG demonstrates the capability to generate temporally stable videos using both linear and non-linear interpolation curves.

Shapiro, Ranjay Krishna","Multimodal language models (MLMs) still face challenges in fundamental visual perception tasks where specialized models excel. Tasks requiring reasoning about 3D structures benefit from depth estimation, and reasoning about 2D object instances benefits from object detection. Yet, MLMs can not produce intermediate depth or boxes to reason over. Finetuning MLMs on relevant data doesn't generalize well and outsourcing computation to specialized vision tools is too compute-intensive and memory-inefficient. To address this, we introduce Perception Tokens, intrinsic image representations designed to assist reasoning tasks where language is insufficient. Perception tokens act as auxiliary reasoning tokens, akin to chain-of-thought prompts in language models. For example, in a depth-related task, an MLM augmented with perception tokens can reason by generating a depth map as tokens, enabling it to solve the problem effectively. We propose AURORA, a training method that augments MLMs with perception tokens for improved reasoning over visual inputs. AURORA leverages a VQVAE to transform intermediate image representations, such as depth maps into a tokenized format and bounding box tokens, which is then used in a multi-task training framework. AURORA achieves notable improvements across counting benchmarks: +10.8% on BLINK, +11.3% on CVBench, and +8.3% on SEED-Bench, outperforming finetuning approaches in generalization across datasets. It also improves on relative depth: over +6% on BLINK. With perception tokens, AURORA expands the scope of MLMs beyond language-based reasoning, paving the way for more effective visual reasoning capabilities.",2025-06-01,22,CVPR

In this paper, we introduce S-Seg, a novel model that can achieve surprisingly strong performance without depending on any of the above elements. S-Seg leverages pseudo-mask and language to train a MaskFormer, and can be easily trained from publicly available image-text datasets. Contrary to prior works, our model directly trains for pixel-level features and language alignment. Once trained, S-Seg generalizes well to multiple testing datasets without requiring fine-tuning. In addition, S-Seg has the extra benefits of scalability with data and consistently improvement when augmented with self-training.

Through our analysis, we uncover that initial noises associated with minority attributes form ""minority regions"" rather than scattered. We view these ""minority regions"" as opportunities in SD to reduce bias. To unlock the potential, we propose a novel de-biasing method called 'weak guidance,' carefully designed to guide a random noise to the minority regions without compromising semantic integrity. Through analysis and experiments on various versions of SD, we demonstrate that our proposed approach effectively reduces bias without additional training, achieving both efficiency and preservation of core image generation functionality.",2025-06-01,4,CVPR

Previous works in natural language processing (NLP) have either focused on open-ended causal reasoning via causal commonsense reasoning (CCR) or framed a symbolic representation-based question answering for theoretically backed-up analysis via a causal inference engine. The former adds an advantage of real-world grounding but lacks theoretically backed-up analysis/validation, whereas the latter is far from real-world grounding. In this work, we bridge this gap by proposing the COLD (Causal reasOning in cLosed Daily activities) framework, which is built upon human understanding of daily real-world activities to reason about the causal nature of events. We show that the proposed framework facilitates the creation of enormous causal queries (∼ 9 million) and comes close to the mini-turing test, simulating causal reasoning to evaluate the understanding of a daily real-world task.

In this paper, we propose STEP, a novel graph-guided self-training method that enables Video-LLMs to generate reasoning-rich fine-tuning data from any raw videos to improve itself. Specifically, we first induce Spatio-Temporal Scene Graph (STSG) representation of diverse videos to capture fine-grained, multi-granular video semantics. Then, the STSGs guide the derivation of multi-step reasoning Question-Answer (QA) data with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) rationales. Both answers and rationales are integrated as training objective, aiming to enhance model's reasoning abilities by supervision over explicit reasoning steps. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of STEP across models of varying scales, with a significant 21.3\% improvement in tasks requiring three or more reasoning steps.

Existing MoE training frameworks usually employ the parallel training strategy so thatfiand the LBL are calculated within amicro-batchand averaged across parallel groups.However, a micro-batch for training billion-scale LLMs typically contains very few sequences, leading to the micro-batch LBL being almost at the sequence level, and the router is pushed to distribute the token evenly within each sequence.Under this strict constraint, even tokens from a domain-specific sequence (e.g., code) are uniformly routed to all experts, thereby inhibiting expert specialization.In this work, we propose calculating LBL using aglobal-batchto loose this constraint. Because a global-batch contains much more diverse sequences than a micro-batch, which will encourage load balance at the corpus level. Specifically, we introduce an extra communication step to synchronizefiacross micro-batches and then use it to calculate the LBL.Through experiments on training MoEs-based LLMs (up to42.8Bparameters and400Btokens), we surprisingly find that the global-batch LBL strategy yields excellent performance gains in both pre-training perplexity and downstream tasks.Our analysis reveals that the global-batch LBL greatly improves the domain specialization of experts.Global-batch LBL is also used in Qwen3-MoEs.",2025-07-01,7,ACL

To address these issues, we propose PartCATSeg, a novel framework that integrates object-aware part-level cost aggregation, compositional loss, and structural guidance from DINO. Our approach employs a disentangled cost aggregation strategy that handles object and part-level costs separately, enhancing the precision of part-level segmentation.

We observe that in QRJA, judges do not have to be people with subjective opinions; for example, a race can be viewed as a ``judgment'' on the contestants' relative abilities. This allows us to aggregate results from multiple races to evaluate the contestants' true qualities.

Recent approaches incorporate semantic or geometric regularization to address this issue, but they suffer significant degradation in underconstrained areas and fail to recover occluded regions. We argue that the key to solving this problem lies in supplementing missing information for these areas. To this end, we propose DP-Recon, which employs diffusion priors in the form of Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) to optimize the neural representation of each individual object under novel views. This provides additional information for the underconstrained areas, but directly incorporating diffusion prior raises potential conflicts between the reconstruction and generative guidance. Therefore, we further introduce a visibility-guided approach to dynamically adjust the per-pixel SDS loss weights. Together these components enhance both geometry and appearance recovery while remaining faithful to input images. Extensive experiments across Replica and ScanNet++ demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms SOTA methods. Notably, it achieves better object reconstruction under 10 views than the baselines under 100 views.

To avoid this problem, we propose a query-based framework that enables adaptive sampling of instance-relevant features from both the bird's-eye view (BEV) and the original image view. Furthermore, we enhance system performance by two key designs: optimizing query initialization and strengthening the representational capacity of BEV.

For the latter, we initially incorporate a radar-guided depth head to refine the transformation from image view to BEV. Subsequently, we focus on leveraging the Doppler effect of radar and introduce an implicit dynamic catcher to capture the temporal elements within the BEV.

Specifically, we focus on the problem of stochastic convex optimization (SCO) with either labeled or unlabeled public data. For complete/labeled public data, we show that any $(\epsilon,\delta)$-PA-DP has excess risk $\tilde{\Omega}\big(\min(\frac{1}{\sqrt{n_{\text{pub}}}},\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}+\frac{\sqrt{d}}{n\epsilon} ) \big)$, where $d$ is the dimension, ${n_{\text{pub}}}$ is the number of public samples, ${n_{\text{priv}}}$ is the number of private samples, and $n={n_{\text{pub}}}+{n_{\text{priv}}}$. These lower bounds are established via our new lower bounds for PA-DP mean estimation, which are of a similar form. Up to constant factors, these lower bounds show that the simple strategy of either treating all data as private or discarding the private data, is optimal. We also study PA-DP supervised learning with \textit{unlabeled} public samples. In contrast to our previous result, we here show novel methods for leveraging public data in private supervised learning. For generalized linear models (GLM) with unlabeled public data, we show an efficient algorithm which, given $\tilde{O}({n_{\text{priv}}}\epsilon)$ unlabeled public samples, achieves the dimension independent rate $\tilde{O}\big(\frac{1}{\sqrt{{n_{\text{priv}}}}} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{{n_{\text{priv}}}\epsilon}}\big)$. We develop new lower bounds for this setting which shows that this rate cannot be improved with more public samples, and any fewer public samples leads to a worse rate.

In particular, uncertainty can be used to improve the trustworthiness of LLMs by detecting factually incorrect model responses, commonly called hallucinations. Critically, one should seek to capture the model's semantic uncertainty, i.e., the uncertainty over the meanings of LLM outputs, rather than uncertainty over lexical or syntactic variations that do not affect answer correctness.To address this problem, we propose Kernel Language Entropy (KLE), a novel method for uncertainty estimation in white- and black-box LLMs. KLE defines positive semidefinite unit trace kernels to encode the semantic similarities of LLM outputs and quantifies uncertainty using the von Neumann entropy. It considers pairwise semantic dependencies between answers (or semantic clusters), providing more fine-grained uncertainty estimates than previous methods based on hard clustering of answers. We theoretically prove that KLE generalizes the previous state-of-the-art method called semantic entropy and empirically demonstrate that it improves uncertainty quantification performance across multiple natural language generation datasets and LLM architectures.",2024-12-16,63,NeurIPS

However, for VLMs, in addition to the loss of knowledge previously learned from downstream tasks, pre-training knowledge is also corrupted during continual fine-tuning. This issue is exacerbated by the unavailability of original pre-training data, leaving VLM's generalization ability degrading. In this paper, we propose GIFT, a novel continual fine-tuning approach that utilizes synthetic data to overcome catastrophic forgetting in VLMs. Taking advantage of recent advances in text-to-image synthesis, we employ a pre-trained diffusion model to recreate both pre-training and learned downstream task data. In this way, the VLM can revisit previous knowledge through distillation on matching diffusion-generated images and corresponding text prompts. Leveraging the broad distribution and high alignment between synthetic image-text pairs in VLM's feature space, we propose a contrastive distillation loss along with an image-text alignment constraint. To further combat in-distribution overfitting and enhance distillation performance with limited amount of generated data, we incorporate adaptive weight consolidation, utilizing Fisher information from these synthetic image-text pairs and achieving a better stability-plasticity balance.

The widely used first-order meta-learning algorithms demonstrate strong performance for domain generalization by leveraging the gradient matching theory, which aims to establish balanced parameters across source domains to reduce overfitting to any particular domain. However, our analysis reveals that there are actually numerous directions to achieve gradient matching, with current methods representing just one possible path. These methods actually overlook another critical factor that the balanced parameters should be close to the centroid of optimal parameters of each source domain. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective arithmetic meta-learning with arithmetic-weighted gradients.

To mitigate this issue, improvements have been made by pruning unnecessary Gaussians, either through a hand-crafted criterion or by using learned masks. However, these methods deterministically remove Gaussians based on a snapshot of the pruning moment, leading to sub-optimized reconstruction performance from a long-term perspective. To address this issue, we introduce MaskGaussian, which models Gaussians as probabilistic entities rather than permanently removing them, and utilize them according to their probability of existence. To achieve this, we propose a masked-rasterization technique that enables unused yet probabilistically existing Gaussians to receive gradients, allowing for dynamic assessment of their contribution to the evolving scene and adjustment of their probability of existence. Hence, the importance of Gaussians iteratively changes and the pruned Gaussians are selected diversely. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method in achieving better rendering quality with fewer Gaussians than previous pruning methods, pruning over 60% of Gaussians on average with only a 0.02 PSNR decline.

This means that in order to effectively retain new knowledge, it is essential to learn it thoroughly and ensure sufficient rest so that our brain can memorize without forgetting. The main takeaway from this theory is that learning extensive data at once necessitates sufficient rest before learning the same data again. This aspect of human long-term memory retention can be effectively utilized to address the continual learning of neural networks. Retaining new knowledge for a long period of time without catastrophic forgetting is the critical problem of continual learning. Therefore, based on Ebbinghaus' theory, we introduce the view-batch model that adjusts the learning schedules to optimize the recall interval between retraining the same samples. The proposed view-batch model allows the network to get enough rest to learn extensive knowledge from the same samples with a recall interval of sufficient length. To this end, we specifically present two approaches: 1) a replay method that guarantees the optimal recall interval, and 2) a self-supervised learning that acquires extensive knowledge from a single training sample at a time. We empirically show that these approaches of our method are aligned with the forgetting curve theory, which can enhance long-term memory.

However, 3DGS in sparse-view settings (e.g., three-view inputs) often faces with the problem of overfitting to training views, which significantly drops the visual quality of novel view images. Many existing approaches have tackled this issue by using strong priors, such as 2D generative contextual information and external depth signals. In contrast, this paper introduces a prior-free method, so-called DropGaussian, with simple changes in 3D Gaussian splatting. Specifically, we randomly remove Gaussians during the training process in a similar way of dropout, which allows non-excluded Gaussians to have larger gradients while improving their visibility. This makes the remaining Gaussians to contribute more to the optimization process for rendering with sparse input views. Such simple operation effectively alleviates the overfitting problem and enhances the quality of novel view synthesis. By simply applying DropGaussian to the original 3DGS framework, we can achieve the competitive performance with existing prior-based 3DGS methods in sparse-view settings of benchmark datasets without any additional complexity.

In this work, we introduce an alternative solution to improve the generalization of image restoration models. Drawing inspiration from recent advancements in Parameter Efficient Transfer Learning (PETL), we aim to tune only a small number of parameters to adapt pre-trained restoration models to various tasks. However, current PETL methods fail to generalize across varied restoration tasks due to their homogeneous representation nature.

Federated learning (FL) further enhances fine-tuning in a privacy-aware manner by utilizing clients' local data through in-situ computation, eliminating the need for data movement. However, fine-tuning LLMs, given their massive scale of parameters, poses challenges for clients with constrained and heterogeneous resources in FL. Previous methods employed low-rank adaptation (LoRA) for efficient federated fine-tuning but utilized traditional FL aggregation strategies on LoRA adapters. This approach led to mathematically inaccurate aggregation noise, reducing fine-tuning effectiveness and failing to address heterogeneous LoRAs.

Our primary motivation stems from observing that existing 3DGS-based open vocabulary methods mainly focus on 2D pixel-level parsing. These methods struggle with 3D point-level tasks due to weak feature expressiveness and inaccurate 2D-3D feature associations. To ensure robust feature presentation and 3D point-level understanding, we first employ SAM masks without cross-frame associations to train instance features with 3D consistency. These features exhibit both intra-object consistency and inter-object distinction. Then, we propose a two-stage codebook to discretize these features from coarse to fine levels. At the coarse level, we consider the positional information of 3D points to achieve location-based clustering, which is then refined at the fine level.Finally, we introduce an instance-level 3D-2D feature association method that links 3D points to 2D masks, which are further associated with 2D CLIP features.

However, current toxicity datasets are typically small and limited to a single organ system (e.g., cardio, renal, or liver). Creating these datasets often involved time-intensive expert curation by parsing drug labelling documents that can exceed 100 pages per drug. Here, we introduce UniTox, a unified dataset of 2,418 FDA-approved drugs with drug-induced toxicity summaries and ratings created by using GPT-4o to process FDA drug labels. UniTox spans eight types of toxicity: cardiotoxicity, liver toxicity, renal toxicity, pulmonary toxicity, hematological toxicity, dermatological toxicity, ototoxicity, and infertility. This is, to the best of our knowledge, the largest such systematic human in vivo database by number of drugs and toxicities, and the first covering nearly all non-combination FDA-approved medications for several of these toxicities. We recruited clinicians to validate a random sample of our GPT-4o annotated toxicities, and UniTox's toxicity ratings concord with clinician labelers 85-96\% of the time. Finally, we benchmark several machine learning models trained on UniTox to demonstrate the utility of this dataset for building molecular toxicity prediction models.",2024-12-16,5,NeurIPS

In this work, we are the first to propose a multi-teacher knowledge distillation framework, namely $\textit{FedMKD}$, to learn global representations with whole class knowledge from heterogeneous clients even under extreme class skew. Firstly, the adaptive knowledge integration mechanism is designed to learn better representations from all heterogeneous models with deviated representation abilities. Then the weighted combination of the self-supervised loss and the distillation loss can support the global model to encode all classes from clients into a unified space. Besides, the global knowledge anchored alignment module can make the local representation spaces close to the global spaces, which further improves the representation abilities of local ones. Finally, extensive experiments conducted on two datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of $\textit{FedMKD}$ which outperforms state-of-the-art baselines 4.78\% under linear evaluation on average.",2024-12-16,2,NeurIPS

Real-world online videos are often plagued by degradations such as blurring and quantization noise, due to the high compression ratio caused by high communication costs and limited transmission bandwidth. These degradations have a particularly serious impact on face videos because the human visual system is highly sensitive to facial details. Despite the significant advancement in video face enhancement, current methods still suffer from $i)$ long processing time and $ii)$ inconsistent spatial-temporal visual effects (e.g., flickering). This study proposes a novel and efficient blind video face enhancement method to overcome the above two challenges, restoring high-quality videos from their compressed low-quality versions with an effective de-flickering mechanism. In particular, the proposed method develops upon a 3D-VQGAN backbone associated with spatial-temporal codebooks recording high-quality portrait features and residual-based temporal information. We develop a two-stage learning framework for the model. In Stage \Rmnum{1}, we learn the model with a regularizer mitigating the codebook collapse problem. In Stage \Rmnum{2}, we learn two transformers to lookup code from the codebooks and further update the encoder of low-quality videos. Experiments conducted on the VFHQ-Test dataset demonstrate that our method surpasses the current state-of-the-art blind face video restoration and de-flickering methods on both efficiency and effectiveness.

On one hand, open-loop evaluation with real data is easy, but these results do not reflect closed-loop performance. On the other, closed-loop evaluation is possible in simulation, but is hard to scale due to its significant computational demands. Further, the simulators available today exhibit a large domain gap to real data. This has resulted in an inability to draw clear conclusions from the rapidly growing body of research on end-to-end autonomous driving. In this paper, we present NAVSIM, a middle ground between these evaluation paradigms, where we use large datasets in combination with a non-reactive simulator to enable large-scale real-world benchmarking. Specifically, we gather simulation-based metrics, such as progress and time to collision, by unrolling bird's eye view abstractions of the test scenes for a short simulation horizon. Our simulation is non-reactive, i.e., the evaluated policy and environment do not influence each other. As we demonstrate empirically, this decoupling allows open-loop metric computation while being better aligned with closed-loop evaluations than traditional displacement errors. NAVSIM enabled a new competition held at CVPR 2024, where 143 teams submitted 463 entries, resulting in several new insights. On a large set of challenging scenarios, we observe that simple methods with moderate compute requirements such as TransFuser can match recent large-scale end-to-end driving architectures such as UniAD. Our modular framework can potentially be extended with new datasets, data curation strategies, and metrics, and will be continually maintained to host future challenges.

We characterize the exact PUT for both finite and continuous data spaces under some mild conditions on the data distributions, and  propose sampling mechanisms that are universally optimal for all $f$-divergences.

It is an important task in video generation but remains an open problem for generative models. This paper pushes the technical frontier of IPT2V in two directions that have not been resolved in literature: (1) A tuning-free pipeline without tedious case-by-case finetuning, and (2) A frequency-aware heuristic identity-preserving DiT-based control scheme. We propose ConsisID, a tuning-free DiT-based controllable IPT2V model to keep human identity consistent in the generated video. Inspired by prior findings in frequency analysis of diffusion transformers, it employs identity-control signals in the frequency domain, where facial features can be decomposed into low-frequency global features and high-frequency intrinsic features. First, from a low-frequency perspective, we introduce a global facial extractor, which encodes reference images and facial key points into a latent space, generating features enriched with low-frequency information. These features are then integrated into shallow layers of the network to alleviate training challenges associated with DiT. Second, from a high-frequency perspective, we design a local facial extractor to capture high-frequency details and inject them into transformer blocks, enhancing the model's ability to preserve fine-grained features. We propose a hierarchical training strategy to leverage frequency information for identity preservation, transforming a vanilla pre-trained video generation model into an IPT2V model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our frequency-aware heuristic scheme provides an optimal control solution for DiT-based models. Thanks to this scheme, our ConsisID generates high-quality, identity-preserving videos, making strides towards more effective IPT2V. Code:this https URL.",2025-06-01,63,CVPR

While many deep learning methods have been developed for general protein binding site prediction tasks, whether they work for epitope prediction remains an understudied research question. The challenge is also heightened by the lack of a consistent evaluation pipeline with sufficient dataset size and epitope diversity. We introduce a filtered antibody-antigen complex structure dataset, AsEP (Antibody-specific Epitope Prediction). AsEP is the largest of its kind and provides clustered epitope groups, allowing the community to develop and test novel epitope prediction methods and evaluate their generalisability. AsEP comes with an easy-to-use interface in Python and pre-built graph representations of each antibody-antigen complex while also supporting customizable embedding methods. Using this new dataset, we benchmark several representative general protein-binding site prediction methods and find that their performances fall short of expectations for epitope prediction. To address this, we propose a novel method, WALLE, which leverages both unstructured modeling from protein language models and structural modeling from graph neural networks. WALLE demonstrate up to 3-10X performance improvement over the baseline methods. Our empirical findings suggest that epitope prediction benefits from combining sequential features provided by language models with geometrical information from graph representations. This provides a guideline for future epitope prediction method design. In addition, we reformulate the task as bipartite link prediction, allowing convenient model performance attribution and interpretability.

However, the absence of data from earlier tasks exacerbates the challenge of catastrophic forgetting in NECIL. In this paper, we propose a novel framework called Dynamic Integration of task-specific Adapters (DIA), which comprises two key components: Task-Specific Adapter Integration (TSAI) and Patch-Level Model Alignment. TSAI boosts compositionality through a patch-level adapter integration strategy, which provides a more flexible compositional solution while maintaining low computation costs. Patch-Level Model Alignment maintains feature consistency and accurate decision boundaries via two specialized mechanisms: Patch-Level Distillation Loss (PDL) and Patch-Level Feature Reconstruction method (PFR). Specifically, the PDL preserves feature-level consistency between successive models by implementing a distillation loss based on the contributions of patch tokens to new class learning. The PFR facilitates accurate classifier alignment by reconstructing old class features from previous tasks that adapt to new task knowledge. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our DIA, revealing significant improvements on benchmark datasets in the NECIL setting, maintaining an optimal balance between computational complexity and accuracy.",2025-06-01,4,CVPR

Recent works utilize feedbacks generated from erroneous cases to guide the prompt optimization. During inference, they may further retrieve several semantically-related exemplars and concatenate them to the optimized prompts to improve the performance. However, those works only utilize the feedback at the current step, ignoring historical and unseleccted feedbacks which are potentially beneficial. Moreover, the selection of exemplars only considers the general semantic relationship and may not be optimal in terms of task performance and matching with the optimized prompt. In this work, we propose an Exemplar-Guided Reflection with Memory mechanism (ERM) to realize more efficient and accurate prompt optimization. Specifically, we design an exemplar-guided reflection mechanism where the feedback generation is additionally guided by the generated exemplars. We further build two kinds of memory to fully utilize the historical feedback information and support more effective exemplar retrieval.

These methods require efficient approximations, and although amortizing the process by learning a network to directly predict the desired output is a promising solution, training such models with exact labels is often infeasible. We therefore explore training amortized models with noisy labels, and we find that this is inexpensive and surprisingly effective. Through theoretical analysis of the label noise and experiments with various models and datasets, we show that this approach tolerates high noise levels and significantly accelerates several feature attribution and data valuation methods, often yielding an order of magnitude speedup over existing approaches.",2024-12-16,13,NeurIPS

We find that existing 3D self-supervised learning approaches fall short when evaluated on representation quality through linear probing. We hypothesize that this is due to what we term the ""geometric shortcut"", which causes representations to collapse to low-level spatial features. This challenge is unique to 3D and arises from the sparse nature of point cloud data. We address it through two key strategies: obscuring spatial information and enhancing the reliance on input features, ultimately composing a Sonata of 140k point clouds through self-distillation. Sonata is simple and intuitive, yet its learned representations are strong and reliable: zero-shot visualizations demonstrate semantic grouping, alongside strong spatial reasoning through nearest-neighbor relationships. Sonata demonstrates exceptional parameter and data efficiency, tripling linear probing accuracy (from 21.8% to 72.5%) on ScanNet and nearly doubling performance with only 1% of the data compared to previous approaches.

However, such ""zero-shot"" restoration schemes currently require many Neural Function Evaluations (NFEs) for performing well, which may be attributed to the many NFEs needed in the original generative functionality of the DMs. Recently, faster variants of DMs have been explored for image generation. These include Consistency Models (CMs), which can generate samples via a couple of NFEs. However, existing works that use guided CMs for restoration still require tens of NFEs or fine-tuning of the model per task that leads to performance drop if the assumptions during the fine-tuning are not accurate. In this paper, we propose a zero-shot restoration scheme that uses CMs and operates well with as little as 4 NFEs. It is based on a wise combination of several ingredients: better initialization, back-projection guidance, and above all a novel noise injection mechanism. We demonstrate the advantages of our approach for image super-resolution, deblurring and inpainting. Interestingly, we show that the usefulness of our noise injection technique goes beyond CMs: it can also mitigate the performance degradation of existing guided DM methods when reducing their NFE count.",2025-06-01,4,CVPR

In this work, we propose the Generalizable Scene Change Detection Framework (GeSCF), which addresses unseen domain performance and temporal consistency -- to meet the growing demand for anything SCD.

However, prevailing RL fine-tuning methods predominantly rely on PPO and its variants. Though these algorithms are effective in general RL settings, they often exhibit suboptimal performance and vulnerability to distribution collapse when applied to the fine-tuning of LLMs. In this paper, we propose CORY, extending the RL fine-tuning of LLMs to a sequential cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning framework, to leverage the inherent coevolution and emergent capabilities of multi-agent systems. In CORY, the LLM to be fine-tuned is initially duplicated into two autonomous agents: a pioneer and an observer. The pioneer generates responses based on queries, while the observer generates responses using both the queries and the pioneer’s responses. The two agents are trained together. During training, the agents exchange roles periodically, fostering cooperation and coevolution between them. Experiments evaluate CORY's performance by fine-tuning GPT-2 and Llama-2 under subjective and objective reward functions on the IMDB Review and GSM8K datasets, respectively.

Patel, Karthik Nandakumar","The rapid proliferation of large-scale text-to-image diffusion (T2ID) models has raised serious concerns about their potential misuse in generating harmful content. Although numerous methods have been proposed for erasing undesired concepts from T2ID models, they often provide a false sense of security; concept-erased models (CEMs) can still be manipulated via adversarial attacks to regenerate the erased concept. While a few robust concept erasure methods based on adversarial training have emerged recently, they compromise on utility (generation quality for benign concepts) to achieve robustness and/or remain vulnerable to advanced embedding space attacks. These limitations stem from the failure of robust CEMs to thoroughly search for ""blind spots"" in the embedding space. To bridge this gap, we propose STEREO, a novel two-stage framework that employs adversarial training as a first step rather than the only step for robust concept erasure. In the first stage, STEREO employs adversarial training as a vulnerability identification mechanism to search thoroughly enough. In the second robustly erase once stage, STEREO introduces an anchor-concept-based compositional objective to robustly erase the target concept in a single fine-tuning stage, while minimizing the degradation of model utility.

Current OOV recommendation models often generate 'makeshift' embeddings for OOV items from content features and then jointly recommend with the `makeshift' OOV item embeddings and the behavioral IV item embeddings. However, merely using the 'makeshift' embedding will result in suboptimal recommendation performance due to the substantial gap between the content feature and the behavioral embeddings. To bridge the gap, we propose a novelUser Sequence IMagination (USIM)fine-tuning framework, which first imagines the user sequences and then refines the generated OOV embeddings with the user behavioral embeddings. Specifically, we frame the user sequence imagination as a reinforcement learning problem and develop a recommendation-focused reward function to evaluate to what extent a user can help recommend the OOV items. Besides, we propose an embedding-driven transition function to model the embedding transition after imaging a user.

Why are two independent systems, both human brains and ANNs, susceptible to the same illusions? Should any ANN be capable of perceiving visual illusions? Are these perceptions a feature or a flaw? In this work, we study how visual illusions are encoded in diffusion models. Remarkably, we show that they present human-like brightness/color shifts in their latent space.

However, these annotations are discrete in nature and do not capture comprehensive descriptions.In this work, we propose DIFFER: Disentangle Identity Features From Entangled Representations, a novel adversarial learning method that leverages textual descriptions to disentangle identity features. Recognizing that image features inherently mix inseparable information, DIFFER introduces NBDetach, a mechanism designed for feature disentanglement by leveraging the separable nature of text descriptions as supervision. It partitions the feature space into distinct subspaces and, through gradient reversal layers, effectively separates identity-related features from non-biometric features. We evaluate DIFFER on 4 different benchmark datasets (LTCC, PRCC, CelebreID-Light, and CCVID) to demonstrate its effectiveness and provide state-of-the-art performance across all the benchmarks.

A useful finding is that almost any kind of record of random walks guarantees probabilistic invariance as long as the vertices are anonymized. This enables us, for example, to record random walks in plain text and adopt a language model to read these text records to solve graph tasks.

Recognizing the complexity of medical scenarios and the limitations of textual or visual prompts, we propose a novel dual-prompt schema that leverages the complementary strengths of visual and textual prompts for segmenting various organs and tumors. Specifically, we introduce $\textbf{\textit{CAT}}$, an innovative model that $\textbf{C}$oordinates $\textbf{A}$natomical prompts derived from 3D cropped images with $\textbf{T}$extual prompts enriched by medical domain knowledge. The model architecture adopts a general query-based design, where prompt queries facilitate segmentation queries for mask prediction. To synergize two types of prompts within a unified framework, we implement a ShareRefiner, which refines both segmentation and prompt queries while disentangling the two types of prompts. Trained on a consortium of 10 public CT datasets, $\textbf{\textit{CAT}}$ demonstrates superior performance in multiple segmentation tasks. Further validation on a specialized in-house dataset reveals the remarkable capacity of segmenting tumors across multiple cancer stages. This approach confirms that coordinating multimodal prompts is a promising avenue for addressing complex scenarios in the medical domain.",2024-12-16,8,NeurIPS

Despite its promise, real-world datasets often contain noisy labels that can degrade prompt learning performance. In this paper, we demonstrate that using mean absolute error (MAE) loss in prompt learning, named PromptMAE, significantly enhances robustness against noisy labels while maintaining high accuracy. Though MAE is straightforward and recognized for its robustness, it is rarely used in noisy-label learning due to its slow convergence and poor performance outside prompt learning scenarios. To elucidate the robustness of PromptMAE, we leverage feature learning theory to show that MAE can suppress the influence of noisy samples, thereby improving the signal-to-noise ratio and enhancing overall robustness. Additionally, we introduce PromptOT, a prompt-based optimal transport data purification method to enhance the robustness further. PromptOT employs text features in vision-language models as prototypes to construct an optimal transportation matrix. This matrix effectively partitions datasets into clean and noisy subsets, allowing for the application of cross-entropy loss to the clean subset and MAE loss to the noisy subset. Our Noise-Label Prompt Learning method, named NLPrompt, offers a simple and efficient approach that leverages the expressive representations and precise alignment capabilities of vision-language models for robust prompt learning. We validate NLPrompt through extensive experiments across various noise settings, demonstrating significant performance improvements.",2025-06-01,3,CVPR

It generates high-fidelity appearance while preserving structural accuracy by simulating hierarchical visual cognition and integrating human artistic experience to guide the diffusion process. LineArt overcomes the limitations of current methods in terms of difficulty in fine-grained control and style degradation in design drawings. It requires no precise 3D modeling, physical property specs, or network training, making it more convenient for design tasks.

However, existing approaches mostly focus on high-quality short video generation (typically 16 or 24 frames), ending up with hard-cuts when naively extended to the case of long video synthesis. To overcome these limitations, we introduce StreamingT2V, an autoregressive approach for long video generation of 80, 240, 600, 1200 or more frames with smooth transitions. The key components are:(i) a short-term memory block called conditional attention module (CAM), which conditions the current generation on the features extracted from the previous chunk via an attentional mechanism, leading to consistent chunk transitions, (ii) a long-term memory block called appearance preservation module, which extracts high-level scene and object features from the first video chunk to prevent the model from forgetting the initial scene, and (iii) a randomized blending approach that enables to apply a video enhancer autoregressively for infinitely long videos without inconsistencies between chunks. Experiments show that StreamingT2V generates high motion amount. In contrast, all competing image-to-video methods are prone to video stagnation when applied naively in an autoregressive manner.

However, acquiring such high-quality trajectory data typically demands meticulous supervision from humans or superior models, which can be either expensive or license-constrained. In this paper, we explore how far an LLM can improve its reasoning by self-synthesizing reasoning paths as training data without any additional supervision. Existing self-synthesizing methods, such as STaR, suffer from poor generalization to out-of-domain (OOD) reasoning tasks. We hypothesize it is due to that their self-synthesized reasoning paths are too task-specific, lacking general task-agnostic reasoning guidance. To address this, we propose **Reasoning Generalist via Self-Improvement (ReGenesis)**, a method to *self-synthesize reasoning paths as post-training data by progressing from abstract to concrete*. More specifically, ReGenesis self-synthesizes reasoning paths by converting general reasoning guidelines into task-specific ones, generating reasoning structures, and subsequently transforming these structures into reasoning paths, without the need for human-designed task-specific examples used in existing methods. We show that ReGenesis achieves superior performance on all in-domain and OOD settings tested compared to existing methods. For six OOD tasks specifically, while previous methods exhibited an average performance decrease of approximately 4.6% after post training, ReGenesis delivers around 6.1% performance improvement. We also conduct an in-depth analysis of our framework and show ReGenesis is effective across various language models and design choices.",2024-10-04,13,ICLR

However, the reward corresponding to an optimal policy is not unique, making it unclear if an IRL-learned reward is transferable to new transition laws in the sense that its optimal policy aligns with the optimal policy corresponding to the expert's true reward. Past work has addressed this problem only under the assumption of full access to the expert's policy, guaranteeing transferability when learning from two experts with the same reward but different transition laws that satisfy a specific rank condition [Rolland et al., 2022]. In this work, we show that the conditions developed under full access to the expert's policy cannot guarantee transferability in the more practical scenario where we have access only to demonstrations of the expert. Instead of a binary rank condition, we propose principal angles as a more refined measure of similarity and dissimilarity between transition laws. Based on this, we then establish two key results: 1) a sufficient condition for transferability to any transition laws when learning from at least two experts with sufficiently different transition laws, and 2) a sufficient condition for transferability to local changes in the transition law when learning from a single expert. Furthermore, we also provide a probably approximately correct (PAC) algorithm and an end-to-end analysis for learning transferable rewards from demonstrations of multiple experts.",2024-12-16,5,NeurIPS

Sampling from pre-trained DPMs involves multiple neural function evaluations (NFEs) to transform Gaussian noise samples into images, resulting in higher computational costs compared to single-step generative models such as GANs or VAEs. Therefore, reducing the number of NFEs while preserving generation quality is crucial. To address this, we propose LD3, a lightweight framework designed to learn the optimal time discretization for sampling.

To address the above limitations, in this work, we introduce an automatic evaluation method that measures retrieval quality through the lens of information gain within the RAG framework. Specifically, we propose Semantic Perplexity (SePer), a metric that captures the LLM's internal belief about the correctness of the retrieved information.

These conversations explicitly target various conversational complexities, such as follow-ups, goal correction and switching, ambiguous and implicit goals.

Evaluations of overall quality, precision, and recall-as well as user studies-demonstrate that the resulting caption model consistently outperforms other SOTA VLM models in generating high-quality captions. Besides, we show that BACON-style captions exhibit better clarity when applied to various models, enabling them to accomplish previously unattainable tasks or surpass existing SOTA solutions without training. For example, BACON-style captions help GroundingDINO achieve 1.51x higher recall scores on open-vocabulary object detection tasks compared to leading methods.",2025-06-01,1,CVPR

With this consistent scene and goal representation, we preserve most structural information compared with pure text and are able to leverage LLM for explicit graph-based reasoning. Specifically, we conduct graph matching between the scene graph and goal graph at each time instant and propose different strategies to generate long-term goal of exploration according to different matching states. The agent first iteratively searches subgraph of goal when zero-matched. With partial matching, the agent then utilizes coordinate projection and anchor pair alignment to infer the goal location. Finally scene graph correction and goal verification are applied for perfect matching. We also present a blacklist mechanism to enable robust switch between stages. Extensive experiments on several benchmarks show that our UniGoal achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on three studied navigation tasks with a single model, even outperforming task-specific zero-shot methods and supervised universal methods.",2025-06-01,17,CVPR

				352-360","Molecular representation learning is vital for various downstream applications, including the analysis and prediction of molecular properties and side effects. While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been a popular framework for modeling molecular data, they often struggle to capture the full complexity of molecular representations. In this paper, we introduce a novel method called Gode, which accounts for the dual-level structure inherent in molecules. Molecules possess an intrinsic graph structure and simultaneously function as nodes within a broader molecular knowledge graph. Gode integrates individual molecular graph representations with multi-domain biochemical data from knowledge graphs. By pre-training two GNNs on different graph structures and employing contrastive learning, Gode effectively fuses molecular structures with their corresponding knowledge graph substructures. This fusion yields a more robust and informative representation, enhancing molecular property predictions by leveraging both chemical and biological information. When fine-tuned across 11 chemical property tasks, our model significantly outperforms existing benchmarks, achieving an average ROC-AUC improvement of 12.7% for classification tasks and an average RMSE/MAE improvement of 34.4% for regression tasks. Notably, Gode surpasses the current leading model in property prediction, with advancements of 2.2% in classification and 7.2% in regression tasks.",2025-04-11,6,AAAI

Christensen, Tuukka Ruotsalo, Lars Maaløe, Maria Maistro","AbstractDeep neural network predictions are notoriously difficult to interpret. Feature attribution methods aim to explain these predictions by identifying the contribution of each input feature. Faithfulness, often evaluated using the area over the perturbation curve (AOPC), reflects feature attributions’ accuracy in describing the internal mechanisms of deep neural networks. However, many studies rely on AOPC to compare faithfulness across different models, which we show can lead to false conclusions about models’ faithfulness. Specifically, we find that AOPC is sensitive to variations in the model, resulting in unreliable cross-model comparisons. Moreover, AOPC scores are difficult to interpret in isolation without knowing the model-specific lower and upper limits. To address these issues, we propose a normalization approach, Normalized AOPC (NAOPC), enabling consistent cross-model evaluations and more meaningful interpretation of individual scores. Our experiments demonstrate that this normalization can radically change AOPC results, questioning the conclusions of earlier studies and offering a more robust framework for assessing feature attribution faithfulness.

We provide comprehensive evaluations, comparisons, and ablation studies that demonstrate how current transductive or TTA methods for VLMs systematically compromise the models' initial zero-shot robustness across various realistic scenarios, favoring performance gains under advantageous assumptions about the test samples' distributions. Furthermore, we introduce StatA, a versatile method that could handle a wide range of deployment scenarios, including those with a variable number of effective classes at test time.

A promising approach to accelerating large VLM inference is using partial information, such as attention maps from specific layers, to assess token importance and prune less essential tokens. However, our study reveals three key insights: (i) Partial attention information is insufficient for accurately identifying critical visual tokens, resulting in suboptimal performance, especially at low token retention ratios; (ii) Global attention information, such as the attention map aggregated across all layers, more effectively preserves essential tokens and maintains comparable performance under aggressive pruning. However, the attention maps from all layers requires a full inference pass, which increases computational load and is therefore impractical in existing methods; and (iii) The global attention map aggregated from a small VLM closely resembles that of a large VLM, suggesting an efficient alternative. Based on these findings, we introduce a \textbf{training-free} method, \underline{\textbf{S}}mall VLM \underline{\textbf{G}}uidance for accelerating \underline{\textbf{L}}arge VLMs (\textbf{SGL}). Specifically, we employ the attention map aggregated from a small VLM to guide visual token pruning in a large VLM. Additionally, an early exiting mechanism is developed to fully use the small VLM's predictions, dynamically invoking the larger VLM only when necessary, yielding a superior trade-off between accuracy and computation.

Improving model generalization ability within each learning phase is one solution to help CL learning overcome the gap in the joint knowledge space. Zeroth-order loss landscape sharpness-aware minimization is a strong training regime improving model generalization in transfer learning compared with optimizer like SGD. It has also been introduced into CL to improve memory representation or learning efficiency. However, zeroth-order sharpness alone could favors sharper over flatter minima in certain scenarios, leading to a rather sensitive minima rather than a global optima. To further enhance learning stability, we propose a Continual Flatness (C-Flat) method featuring a flatter loss landscape tailored for CL.

They assume that MP helps CF methods in a manner akin to its benefits for graph-based learning tasks in general (e.g., node classification). However, even though MP empirically improves CF, whether or not this assumption is correct still needs verification. To address this gap, we formally investigate why MP helps CF from multiple perspectives and show that many assumptions made by previous works are not entirely accurate. With our curated ablation studies and theoretical analyses, we discover that (i) MP improves the CF performance primarily by additional representations passed from neighbors during the forward pass instead of additional gradient updates to neighbor representations during the model back-propagation and (ii) MP usually helps low-degree nodes more than high-degree nodes.}Utilizing these novel findings, we present Test-time Aggregation for Collaborative Filtering, namely TAG-CF, a test-time augmentation framework that only conducts MP once at inference time. The key novelty of TAG-CF is that it effectively utilizes graph knowledge while circumventing most of notorious computational overheads of MP. Besides, TAG-CF is extremely versatile can be used as a plug-and-play module to enhance representations trained by different CF supervision signals. Evaluated on six datasets (i.e., five academic benchmarks and one real-world industrial dataset), TAG-CF consistently improves the recommendation performance of CF methods without graph by up to 39.2% on cold users and 31.7% on all users, with little to no extra computational overheads.

Nonetheless, LLMs are often criticized for their tendency to produce hallucinations, wherein the models fabricate incorrect statements on tasks beyond their knowledge and perception. To alleviate this issue, graph retrieval-augmented generation (GraphRAG) has been extensively explored which leverages the factual knowledge in knowledge graphs (KGs) to ground the LLM's responses in established facts and principles. However, most state-of-the-art LLMs are closed-source, making it challenging to develop a prompting framework that can efficiently and effectively integrate KGs into LLMs with hard prompts only.

Traditional parameterization approaches are designed for high-quality meshes laboriously created by specialized 3D modelers, thus unable to meet the processing demand for the current explosion of ordinary 3D data. Moreover, their working mechanisms are typically restricted to certain simple topologies, thus relying on cumbersome manual efforts (e.g., surface cutting, part segmentation) for pre-processing. In this paper, we introduce the Flatten Anything Model (FAM), an unsupervised neural architecture to achieve global free-boundary surface parameterization via learning point-wise mappings between 3D points on the target geometric surface and adaptively-deformed UV coordinates within the 2D parameter domain. To mimic the actual physical procedures, we ingeniously construct geometrically-interpretable sub-networks with specific functionalities of surface cutting, UV deforming, unwrapping, and wrapping, which are assembled into a bi-directional cycle mapping framework. Compared with previous methods, our FAM directly operates on discrete surface points without utilizing connectivity information, thus significantly reducing the strict requirements for mesh quality and even applicable to unstructured point cloud data. More importantly, our FAM is fully-automated without the need for pre-cutting and can deal with highly-complex topologies, since its learning process adaptively finds reasonable cutting seams and UV boundaries.

However, the scarcity of real-world CAD data poses challenges in directly training such models. To tackle these challenges, we propose CADCrafter, an image-to-parametric CAD model generation framework that trains solely on synthetic textureless CAD data while testing on real-world images. To bridge the significant representation disparity between images and parametric CAD models, we introduce a geometry encoder to accurately capture diverse geometric features. Moreover, the texture-invariant properties of the geometric features can also facilitate the generalization to real-world scenarios. Since compiling CAD parameter sequences into explicit CAD models is a non-differentiable process, the network training inherently lacks explicit geometric supervision. To impose geometric validity constraints, we employ direct preference optimization (DPO) to fine-tune our model with the automatic code checker feedback on CAD sequence quality.

Nevertheless, existing segmentation frameworks impose a pre-processing step of scene-specific parameter training, which limits the efficiency and flexibility of scene manipulation. To deliver a 3D region control module that is well-suited for scene manipulation with reliable efficiency, we propose interactive Segment-and-Manipulate 3D Gaussians (iSegMan), an interactive segmentation and manipulation framework that only requires simple 2D user interactions in any view.

In this study, we introduce a novel visual-language alignment method that casts the key issue as a Visual Question Answering with Mask generation (VQAMask) task, optimizing two tasks simultaneously: VQA-based text parsing and mask generation. The former allows the model to implicitly align images and text at the semantic level.

After fine-tuning using Diffusion-KTO, text-to-image diffusion models exhibit improved performance compared to existing techniques, including supervised fine-tuning and Diffusion-DPO, both in terms of human judgment and automatic evaluation metrics such as PickScore and ImageReward.

However, existing collaborative perception methods face a dilemma between communication efficiency and perception accuracy. To address this issue, we propose a novel communication-efficient collaborative perception framework based on supply-demand awareness and intermediate-late hybridization, dubbed as \mymethodname. By modeling the supply-demand relationship between agents, the framework refines the selection of collaboration regions, reducing unnecessary communication cost while maintaining accuracy. In addition, we innovatively introduce the intermediate-late hybrid collaboration mode, where late-stage collaboration compensates for the performance degradation in collaborative perception under low communication bandwidth. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets, including both simulated and real-world scenarios, demonstrate that \mymethodname~ achieves state-of-the-art detection accuracy and optimal bandwidth trade-offs, delivering superior detection precision under real communication bandwidths, thus proving its effectiveness and practical applicability.

Recognizing the limitations of current 2D inpainting tools for restoring 3D locations, our approach proposes joint Poisson fields to repair and expand the Gaussians of both objects and contacted scenes after separation. This is complemented by a multi-carve strategy to refine the object's geometry. Our system enables realistic simulations of decoupling motions, collisions, and fractures driven by user-specified impulses, supporting complex interactions within and across multiple scenes.

The system simultaneously captures pixel-aligned pairs of RGB stereo images, NIR stereo images, and temporally synchronized LiDAR points. Utilizing the mobility of the robot, we present a dataset containing continuous video frames under diverse lighting conditions. We then introduce two methods that utilize the pixel-aligned RGB-NIR images: an RGB-NIR image fusion method and a feature fusion method.

Compared with previous 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) methods that requires elusive multi-view datasets or tedious personalized learning/inference, MGGtalk enables more practical and broader applications. However, in the absence of multi-view and personalized training data, the incompleteness of geometric and appearance information poses a significant challenge. To address these challenges, MGGTalk explores depth information to enhance geometric and facial symmetry characteristics to supplement both geometric and appearance features. Initially, based on the pixel-wise geometric information obtained from depth estimation, we incorporate symmetry operations and point cloud filtering techniques to ensure a complete and precise position parameter for 3DGS. Subsequently, we adopt a two-stage strategy with symmetric priors for predicting the remaining 3DGS parameters. We begin by predicting Gaussian parameters for the visible facial regions of the source image. These parameters are subsequently utilized to improve the prediction of Gaussian parameters for the non-visible regions.

Over the past decade, mainstream methods in the VPR area have been to use feature representation based on global aggregation, as exemplified by NetVLAD. These features are suitable for large-scale VPR and robust against viewpoint changes. However, the VLAD-based aggregation methods usually learn a large number of (e.g., 64) clusters and their corresponding cluster centers, which directly leads to a high dimension of the yielded global features. More importantly, when there is a domain gap between the data in training and inference, the cluster centers determined on the training set are usually improper for inference, resulting in a performance drop. To this end, we first attempt to improve NetVLAD by removing the cluster center and setting only a small number of (e.g., only 4) clusters. The proposed method not only simplifies NetVLAD but also enhances the generalizability across different domains. We name this method SuperVLAD. In addition, by introducing ghost clusters that will not be retained in the final output, we further propose a very low-dimensional 1-Cluster VLAD descriptor, which has the same dimension as the output of GeM pooling but performs notably better. Experimental results suggest that, when paired with a transformer-based backbone, our SuperVLAD shows better domain generalization performance than NetVLAD with significantly fewer parameters.

However, considering security, capacity, invisibility, and training efficiency, the copyright of 3DGS assets is not well protected as existing watermarking methods are unsuited for its rendering pipeline. In this paper, we propose GuardSplat, an innovative and efficient framework for watermarking 3DGS assets. Specifically, 1) We propose a CLIP-guided pipeline for optimizing the message decoder with minimal costs. The key objective is to achieve high-accuracy extraction by leveraging CLIP's aligning capability and rich representations, demonstrating exceptional capacity and efficiency. 2) We tailor a Spherical-Harmonic-aware (SH-aware) Message Embedding module for 3DGS, seamlessly embedding messages into the SH features of each 3D Gaussian while preserving the original 3D structure. This enables watermarking 3DGS assets with minimal fidelity trade-offs and prevents malicious users from removing the watermarks from the model files, meeting the demands for invisibility and security. 3) We present an Anti-distortion Message Extraction module to improve robustness against various distortions.

In this paper, we explore large-scale training for Video LLM with cheap automatic speech recognition (ASR) transcripts. Specifically, we propose a novel streaming training approach that densely interleaves the ASR words and video frames according to their timestamps. Compared to previous studies in vision-language representation with ASR, our method naturally fits the streaming characteristics of ASR, thus enabling the model to learn temporally-aligned, fine-grained vision-language modeling. To support the training algorithm, we introduce a data production pipeline to process YouTube videos and their closed captions (CC, same as ASR), resulting in Live-CC-5M dataset for pre-training and Live-WhisperX-526K dataset for high-quality supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Remarkably, even without SFT, the ASR-only pre-trained LiveCC-7B-Base model demonstrates competitive general video QA performance and exhibits a new capability in real-time video commentary. To evaluate this, we carefully design a new LiveSports-3K benchmark, using LLM-as-a-judge to measure the free-form commentary. Experiments show our final LiveCC-7B-Instruct model can surpass advanced 72B models (Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct, LLaVA-Video-72B) in commentary quality even working in a real-time mode.

Specifically, this approach leverages readily available reference images to learn inclusive prompts for each target Sensitive Attribute (tSA), allowing for fair image generation. In this work, we first reveal that this prompt learning-based approach results in degraded sample quality. Our analysis shows that the approach's training objective--which aims to align the embedding differences of learned prompts and reference images-- could be sub-optimal, resulting in distortion of the learned prompts and degraded generated images. To further substantiate this claim,as our major contribution, we deep dive into the denoising subnetwork of the T2I model to track down the effect of these learned prompts by analyzing the cross-attention maps. In our analysis, we propose a novel prompt switching analysis: I2H and H2I. Furthermore, we propose new quantitative characterization of cross-attention maps. Our analysis reveals abnormalities in the early denoising steps, perpetuating improper global structure that results in degradation in the generated samples. Building on insights from our analysis, we propose two ideas: (i)Prompt Queuingand (ii)Attention Amplificationto address the quality issue. Extensive experimental results on a wide range of tSAs show that our proposed method outperforms SOTA approach's image generation quality, while achieving competitive fairness.

Existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs) concentrate on natural RGB images, failing in scenarios where event data fits better. In this paper, we introduce EventGPT, the first MLLM for event stream understanding, to the best of our knowledge, marking a pioneering attempt to integrate large language models (LLMs) with event stream comprehension. To mitigate the huge domain gaps, we develop a three-stage optimization paradigm to gradually equip a pre-trained LLM with the capability of understanding event-based scenes. Our EventGPT comprises an event encoder, followed by a spatio-temporal aggregator, a linear projector, an event-language adapter, and an LLM. Firstly, RGB image-text pairs generated by GPT are leveraged to warm up the linear projector, referring to LLaVA, as the gap between natural image and language modalities is relatively smaller. Secondly, we construct a synthetic yet large dataset, N-ImageNet-Chat, consisting of event frames and corresponding texts to enable the use of the spatio-temporal aggregator and to train the event-language adapter, thereby aligning event features more closely with the language space. Finally, we gather an instruction dataset, Event-Chat, which contains extensive real-world data to fine-tune the entire model, further enhancing its generalization ability.

Nonetheless, the precise mechanism of compositionality and how it is acquired through training remains elusive. Here, we consider a highly reduced setting to examine whether diffusion models learn semantically meaningful and fully factorized representations of composable features. We performed extensive controlled experiments on conditional DDPMs trained to generate various forms of 2D Gaussian data. We demonstrate that the models learn factorized, semi-continuous manifold representations that are orthogonal in underlying continuous latent features of independent variations but are not aligned for different values of the same feature. With such representations, models demonstrate superior compositionality but have limited ability to interpolate over unseen values of a given feature. Our experimental results further demonstrate that diffusion models can attain compositionality with a small amount of compositional examples, suggesting a novel way to train DDPMs. Finally, we connect manifold formation in diffusion models to percolation theory in physics, thereby offering insights into the sudden onset of factorized representation learning. Our thorough toy experiments thus contribute a deeper understanding of how diffusion models capture compositional structure in data, paving the way for future research aimed at enhancing factorization and compositional generalization in generative models for real-world applications.",2024-12-16,11,NeurIPS

Enter Query Localization!,"Yuheng Chen, Pengfei Cao, Yubo Chen, Kang Liu, Jun Zhao","Large language models (LLMs) store extensive factual knowledge, but the mechanisms behind how they store and express this knowledge remain unclear.
The Knowledge Neuron (KN) thesis is a prominent theory for explaining these mechanisms. This theory is based on the **Knowledge Localization (KL)** assumption, which suggests that a fact can be localized to a few knowledge storage units, namely knowledge neurons.
 However, this assumption has two limitations: first, it may be too rigid  regarding knowledge storage, and second, it neglects the role of the attention module in  knowledge expression. 
 
In this paper, we first re-examine the KL assumption and demonstrate that its limitations do indeed exist. To address these, we then present two new findings, each targeting one of the limitations: one focusing on knowledge storage and the other on knowledge expression.
We summarize these findings as **Query Localization** assumption and argue that the KL assumption can be viewed as a simplification of the QL assumption. 
Based on QL assumption, we further propose  the Consistency-Aware KN modification method, which improves the performance of knowledge modification,  further validating our new assumption.

Current solutions, including statistical and deep learning methods, often fail to effectively integrate gene interaction knowledge from databases or explicitly learn subtype-specific interactions. To address this mismatch, we propose GeSubNet, which learns a unified representation capable of predicting gene interactions while distinguishing between different disease subtypes. Graphs generated by such representations can be considered subtype-specific networks. GeSubNet is a multi-step representation learning framework with three modules: First, a deep generative model learns distinct disease subtypes from patient gene expression profiles. Second, a graph neural network captures representations of prior gene networks from knowledge databases, ensuring accurate physical gene interactions. Finally, we integrate these two representations using an inference loss that leverages graph generation capabilities, conditioned on the patient separation loss, to refine subtype-specific information in the learned representation. GeSubNet consistently outperforms traditional methods, with average improvements of 30.6%, 21.0%, 20.1%, and 56.6% across four graph evaluation metrics, averaged over four cancer datasets. Particularly, we conduct a biological simulation experiment to assess how the behavior of selected genes from over 11,000 candidates affects subtypes or patient distributions.

We conduct extensive experiments to explore the design space of pre-training distillation and find better configurations and interesting conclusions, such as larger student LLMs generally benefiting more from pre-training distillation, while a larger teacher LLM does not necessarily guarantee better results.

Typical training data consists of triplets containing a reference image, a textual description of desired modifications, and the target image, which are expensive and time-consuming to acquire. The scarcity of CIR datasets has led to zero-shot approaches utilizing synthetic triplets or leveraging vision-language models (VLMs) with ubiquitous web-crawled image-caption pairs. However, these methods have significant limitations: synthetic triplets suffer from limited scale, lack of diversity, and unnatural modification text, while image-caption pairs hinder joint embedding learning of the multimodal query due to the absence of triplet data. Moreover, existing approaches struggle with complex and nuanced modification texts that demand sophisticated fusion and understanding of vision and language modalities. We present CoLLM, a one-stop framework that effectively addresses these limitations.

However, the current state-of-the-art generation models, like Stable Diffusion, cannot handle fine-grained part-level attributes in the text prompts. Specifically, when additional attribute details are added to the base text prompt, these text-to-image models either generate an image vastly different from the image generated from the base prompt or ignore the attribute details. To mitigate these issues, we introduce PartComposer, a training-free method that enables image generation based on fine-grained part-level attributes specified for objects in the base text prompt. This allows more control for artists and enables novel object compositions by combining distinctive object parts. PartComposer first localizes object parts by denoising the object region from a specific diffusion process. This enables each part token to be localized to the right region. After obtaining part masks, we run a localized diffusion process in each part region based on fine-grained part attributes and combine them to produce the final image.

Traditional FU methods often depend on auxiliary storage on either the client or server side or require direct access to the data targeted for removal-a dependency that may not be feasible if the data is no longer available. To overcome these limitations, we propose NoT, a novel and efficient FU algorithm based on weight negation (multiplying by -1), which circumvents the need for additional storage and access to the target data. We argue that effective and efficient unlearning can be achieved by perturbing model parameters away from the set of optimal parameters, yet being well-positioned for quick re-optimization. This technique, though seemingly contradictory, is theoretically grounded: we prove that the weight negation perturbation effectively disrupts inter-layer co-adaptation, inducing unlearning while preserving an approximate optimality property, thereby enabling rapid recovery. Experimental results across three datasets and three model architectures demonstrate that NoT significantly outperforms existing baselines in unlearning efficacy as well as in communication and computational efficiency.",2025-06-01,5,CVPR

Although current PTQ methods have achieved promising results by addressing outliers and employing layer- or block-wise loss optimization techniques, they still suffer from significant performance degradation at ultra-low bits precision. To dissect this issue, we conducted an in-depth analysis of quantization errors specific to LLMs and surprisingly discovered that, unlike traditional sources of quantization errors, the growing number of model parameters, combined with the reduction in quantization bits, intensifies inter-layer and intra-layer dependencies, which severely impact quantization accuracy. This finding highlights a critical challenge in quantizing LLMs. To address this, we propose CBQ, a cross-block reconstruction-based PTQ method for LLMs. CBQ leverages a cross-block dependency to establish long-range dependencies across multiple blocks and integrates an adaptive LoRA-Rounding technique to manage intra-layer dependencies. To further enhance performance, CBQ incorporates a coarse-to-fine pre-processing mechanism for processing weights and activations. Extensive experiments show that CBQ achieves superior low-bit quantization (W4A4, W4A8, W2A16) and outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods across various LLMs and datasets. Notably, CBQ only takes 4.3 hours to quantize a weight-only quantization of a 4-bit LLAMA1-65B model, achieving a commendable trade off between performance and efficiency.",2024-10-04,23,ICLR

Such limitation prohibits their direct use in egocentric video settings, where hands and camera are continuously in motion.

We propose to decouple the task by reconstructing the hand motion in the camera space and estimating the camera trajectory in the world coordinate system. To achieve precise camera trajectory estimation, we propose an adaptive egocentric SLAM framework that addresses the shortcomings of traditional SLAM methods, providing robust performance under challenging camera dynamics. To ensure robust hand motion trajectories, even when the hands move out of view frustum, we devise a novel motion infiller network that effectively completes the missing frames of the sequence.

To address this challenge, we propose WAVE, a novel approach that reformulates variable-sized model initialization from a multi-task perspective, where initializing each model size is treated as a distinct task. WAVE employs shared, size-agnostic weight templates alongside size-specific weight scalers to achieve consistent initialization across various model sizes. These weight templates, constructed within the Learngene framework, integrate knowledge from pre-trained models through a distillation process constrained by Kronecker-based rules. Target models are then initialized by concatenating and weighting these templates, with adaptive connection rules established by lightweight weight scalers, whose parameters are learned from minimal training data.

Existing approaches attempt to regulate the prompt tuning process to balance BNT by appending constraints. However, imposed on the same target prompt, these constraints fail to fully avert the mutual exclusivity between the optimization directions for base and new. As a novel solution to this challenge, we propose the plug-and-play Dual-Prompt Collaboration (DPC) framework, the first that decoupling the optimization processes of base and new tasks at the prompt level.

Meanwhile, we propose a Dynamic Hard Negative Optimizer, utilizing dual prompts to construct a more challenging optimization task on base classes for enhancement. For interpretability, we prove the feature channel invariance of the prompt vector during the optimization process, providing theoretical support for the Weighting-Decoupling of DPC.

However, current methods struggle with combining multiple personalized models, often leading to attribute entanglement or requiring separate training to preserve concept distinctiveness. We present LoRACLR, a novel approach for multi-concept image generation that merges multiple LoRA models, each fine-tuned for a distinct concept, into a single, unified model without additional individual fine-tuning. LoRACLR uses a contrastive objective to align and merge the weight spaces of these models, ensuring compatibility while minimizing interference. By enforcing distinct yet cohesive representations for each concept, LoRACLR enables efficient, scalable model composition for high-quality, multi-concept image synthesis.

At present, efficient and scalable verification techniques are always sound but incomplete, and thus, the improvement of verified robustness results is the key criterion to evaluate the performance of incomplete verification approaches. The multi-variate function MaxPool is widely adopted yet challenging to verify. In this paper, we present Ti-Lin, a robustness verifier for MaxPool-based CNNs with Tight Linear Approximation. Following the sequel of minimizing the over-approximation zone of the non-linear function of CNNs, we are the first to propose the provably neuron-wise tightest linear bounds for the MaxPool function. By our proposed linear bounds, we can certify larger robustness results for CNNs. We evaluate the effectiveness of Ti-Lin on different verification frameworks with open-sourced benchmarks, including LeNet, PointNet, and networks trained on the MNIST, CIFAR-10, Tiny ImageNet and ModelNet40 datasets.

Are the current large AI models indeed capable of generalized problem solving as humans do?  A systematic analysis of AI capabilities for joint vision and text reasoning, however, is missing in the current scientific literature. In this paper, we make an effort towards filling this gap, by evaluating state-of-the-art LVLMs on their mathematical and algorithmic reasoning abilities using visuo-linguistic problems from children's Olympiads. Specifically, we consider problems from the Mathematical Kangaroo (MK) Olympiad, which is a popular international competition targeted at children from grades 1-12, that tests children's deeper mathematical abilities using puzzles that are appropriately gauged to their age and skills. Using the puzzles from MK, we created a dataset, dubbed SMART-840, consisting of 840 problems from years 2020-2024. With our dataset, we analyze LVLMs power on mathematical reasoning; their responses on our puzzles offer a direct way to compare against that of children. Our results show that modern LVLMs do demonstrate increasingly powerful reasoning skills in solving problems for higher grades, but lack the foundations to correctly answer problems designed for younger children. Further analysis shows that there is no significant correlation between the reasoning capabilities of AI models and that of young children, and their capabilities appear to be based on a different type of reasoning than the cumulative knowledge that underlies children's mathematical skills.",2024-12-16,10,NeurIPS

While there have been great advances in visual representation learning, such advances have focused on building better representations for a small number of discrete objects bereft of an understanding of how these objects are interacting. One can observe this limitation in representations learned through captions or contrastive learning -- where the learned model treats an image essentially as a bag of words. Several works have attempted to address this limitation through the development of bespoke learned architectures to directly address the shortcomings in compositional learning. In this work, we focus on simple, and scalable approaches. In particular, we demonstrate that by substantially improving weakly labeled data, i.e. captions, we can vastly improve the performance of standard contrastive learning approaches. Previous CLIP models achieved near chance rate on challenging tasks probing compositional learning.

For instance, when crossing at an intersection, blind individuals may have different patterns of movement, such as veering more from a straight path or using touch-based exploration around curbs and obstacles. These behaviors may appear less predictable to motion models embedded in technologies such as autonomous vehicles. Yet, the ability of 3D motion models to capture such behavior has not been previously studied, as existing datasets for 3D human motion currently lack diversity and are biased toward people who are sighted.

In multi-view scenarios, MCL tends to prioritize shared information while neglecting modality-specific unique information across different views, leading to feature suppression and suboptimal performance in downstream tasks. To address these limitations, we propose a novel contrastive framework nameQUEST: Quadruple Multimodal Contrastive Learning with Constraints and Self-Penalization. In the QUEST framework, we propose quaternion contrastive objectives and orthogonal constraints to extract sufficient unique information.

While many Stable Diffusion (SD)-based Real-ISR methods have achieved remarkable success, their slow, multi-step inference hinders practical deployment. Recent SD-based one-step networks like OSEDiff and S3Diff alleviate this issue but still incur high computational costs due to their reliance on large pretrained SD models. This paper proposes a novel Real-ISR method, AdcSR, by distilling the one-step diffusion network OSEDiff into a streamlined diffusion-GAN model under our Adversarial Diffusion Compression (ADC) framework. We meticulously examine the modules of OSEDiff, categorizing them into two types: (1) Removable (VAE encoder, prompt extractor, text encoder, etc.) and (2) Prunable (denoising UNet and VAE decoder). Since direct removal and pruning can degrade the model's generation capability, we pretrain our pruned VAE decoder to restore its ability to decode images and employ adversarial distillation to compensate for performance loss. This ADC-based diffusion-GAN hybrid design effectively reduces complexity by 73% in inference time, 78% in computation, and 74% in parameters, while preserving the model's generation capability.

The self-attention mechanism provides a general solution for sequence modeling, but it has a prohibitive cost when applied to a massive number of spatiotemporal tokens in long videos. Most prior methods rely on compression strategies to lower the computational cost, such as reducing the input length via sparse frame sampling or compressing the output sequence passed to the large language model (LLM) via space-time pooling. However, these naive approaches over-represent redundant information and often miss salient events or fast-occurring space-time patterns.

In this paper, we introduce a Sampling Innovation-Based ACS (SIB-ACS) method that can effectively identify and allocate sampling to challenging image reconstruction areas, culminating in high-fidelity image reconstruction. An innovation criterion is proposed to judge ASA by predicting the decrease in image reconstruction error attributable to sampling increments, thereby directing more samples towards regions where the reconstruction error diminishes significantly. A sampling innovation-guided multi-stage adaptive sampling (AS) framework is proposed, which iteratively refines the ASA through a multi-stage feedback process.

In this work, we analyze camera motion from a first principles perspective, uncovering insights that enable precise 3D camera manipulation without compromising synthesis quality. First, we determine that motion induced by camera movements in videos is low-frequency in nature. This motivates us to adjust train and test pose conditioning schedules, accelerating training convergence while improving visual and motion quality. Then, by probing the representations of an unconditional video diffusion transformer, we observe that they implicitly perform camera pose estimation under the hood, and only a sub-portion of their layers contain the camera information. This suggested us to limit the injection of camera conditioning to a subset of the architecture to prevent interference with other video features, leading to a 4x reduction of training parameters, improved training speed, and 10% higher visual quality. Finally, we complement the typical dataset for camera control learning with a curated dataset of 20K diverse, dynamic videos with stationary cameras.

However, such additions often promote over-smoothing that renders nodes of different classes less distinguishable. Inspired by the Braess phenomenon, we argue that deleting edges can address over-squashing and over-smoothing simultaneously.

Motivated by the Mori-Zwanzig theory of model reduction, we theoretically exhibit examples of simple (even linear) PDEs, in which a solution that uses memory is arbitrarily better than a Markovian solution. Additionally, we introduce Memory Neural Operator (MemNO), a neural operator architecture that combines recent state space models (specifically, S4) and Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) to effectively model memory.  We empirically demonstrate that when the PDEs are supplied in low resolution or contain observation noise at train and test time, MemNO significantly outperforms the baselines without memory---with up to $6 \times$ reduction in test error. Furthermore, we show that this benefit is particularly pronounced when the PDE solutions have significant high-frequency Fourier modes (e.g., low-viscosity fluid dynamics) and we construct a challenging benchmark dataset consisting of such PDEs.",2024-10-04,12,ICLR

These abilities emerge with minimal supervision during the early stages of human visual development. Despite their significance, current self-supervised learning (SSL) approaches are primarily designed and evaluated for high-level recognition tasks, leaving their mid-level vision capabilities largely unexamined.In this study, we introduce a suite of benchmark protocols to systematically assess mid-level vision capabilities and present a comprehensive, controlled evaluation of 22 prominent SSL models across 8 mid-level vision tasks. Our experiments reveal a weak correlation between mid-level and high-level task performance. We also identify several SSL methods with highly imbalanced performance across mid-level and high-level capabilities, as well as some that excel in both. Additionally, we investigate key factors contributing to mid-level vision performance, such as pretraining objectives and network architectures. Our study provides a holistic and timely view of what SSL models have learned, complementing existing research that primarily focuses on high-level vision tasks.

Network quantization, as a standard compression and acceleration technique, reduces storage costs and enables potential inference acceleration by discretizing network weights and activations into a finite set of integer values. However, current quantization methods are often complex and sensitive, requiring extensive task-specific hyperparameters, where even a single misconfiguration can impair model performance, limiting generality across different models and tasks. In this paper, we propose Quantization without Tears (QwT), a method that simultaneously achieves quantization speed, accuracy, simplicity, and generality. The key insight of QwT is to incorporate a lightweight additional structure into the quantized network to mitigate information loss during quantization. This structure consists solely of a small set of linear layers, keeping the method simple and efficient. More importantly, it provides a closed-form solution, allowing us to improve accuracy effortlessly under 2 minutes. Extensive experiments across various vision, language, and multimodal tasks demonstrate that QwT is both highly effective and versatile. In fact, our approach offers a robust solution for network quantization that combines simplicity, accuracy, and adaptability, which provides new insights for the design of novel quantization paradigms.

Diffusion Models are the current state-of-the-art in generative modeling due to their exceptional ability to accurately learn and represent complex, multi-modal distributions. This ability allows Diffusion Models to replicate the inherent diversity in human behavior, making them the preferred models in behavior learning such as Learning from Human Demonstrations (LfD).However, diffusion models come with some drawbacks, including the intractability of likelihoods and long inference times due to their iterative sampling process. The inference times, in particular, pose a significant challenge to real-time applications such as robot control.In contrast, MoEs effectively address the aforementioned issues while retaining the ability to represent complex distributions but are notoriously difficult to train.VDD is the first method that distills pre-trained diffusion models into MoE models, and hence, combines the expressiveness of Diffusion Models with the benefits of Mixture Models.Specifically, VDD leverages a decompositional upper bound of the variational objective that allows the training of each expert separately, resulting in a robust optimization scheme for MoEs.VDD demonstrates across nine complex behavior learning tasks, that it is able to: i) accurately distill complex distributions learned by the diffusion model, ii) outperform existing state-of-the-art distillation methods, and iii) surpass conventional methods for training MoE.

In this work, we present EgoLM, a versatile framework that tracks and understands egocentric motions from multi-modal inputs, e.g., egocentric videos and motion sensors. EgoLM exploits rich contexts for the disambiguation of egomotion tracking and understanding, which are ill-posed under single modality conditions. To facilitate the versatile and multi-modal framework, our key insight is to model the joint distribution of egocentric motions and natural languages using large language models (LLM). Multi-modal sensor inputs are encoded and projected to the joint latent space of language models, and used to prompt motion generation or text generation for egomotion tracking or understanding, respectively.

Let $n,T,\bar{d}$ denote the dimensionality, time horizon, and average delay, respectively. Previous studies have achieved an $O(\sqrt{n}T^{3/4}+(n\bar{d})^{1/3}T^{2/3})$ regret bound for this problem, whose delay-independent part matches the regret of the classical non-delayed bandit gradient descent algorithm. However, there is a large gap between its delay-dependent part, i.e., $O((n\bar{d})^{1/3}T^{2/3})$, and an existing $\Omega(\sqrt{\bar{d}T})$ lower bound. In this paper, we illustrate that this gap can be filled in the worst case, where $\bar{d}$ is very close to the maximum delay $d$. Specifically, we first develop a novel algorithm, and prove that it enjoys a regret bound of $O(\sqrt{n}T^{3/4}+\sqrt{dT})$ in general. Compared with the previous result, our regret bound is better for $d=O((n\bar{d})^{2/3}T^{1/3})$, and the delay-dependent part is tight in the worst case. The primary idea is to decouple the joint effect of the delays and the bandit feedback on the regret by carefully incorporating the delayed bandit feedback with a blocking update mechanism. Furthermore, we show that the proposed algorithm can improve the regret bound to $O((nT)^{2/3}\log^{1/3}T+d\log T)$ for strongly convex functions. Finally, if the action sets are unconstrained, we demonstrate that it can be simply extended to achieve an $O(n\sqrt{T\log T}+d\log T)$ regret bound for strongly convex and smooth functions.",2024-12-16,6,NeurIPS

Due to the absence of a powerful Gaussian ray tracer, previous 3DGS-based methods have either adopted a simplified rendering equation or used learnable parameters to approximate incident light, resulting in inaccurate material and lighting estimations. To this end, we introduce inter-reflective Gaussian splatting (IRGS) for inverse rendering. To capture inter-reflection, we apply the full rendering equation without simplification and compute incident radiance on the fly using the proposed differentiable 2D Gaussian ray tracing. Additionally, we present an efficient optimization scheme to handle the computational demands of Monte Carlo sampling for rendering equation evaluation. Furthermore, we introduce a novel strategy for querying the indirect radiance of incident light when relighting the optimized scenes.

While diffusion-based methods have shown promise in text generation, they still struggle to produce high-quality results. These methods often generate distorted or unrecognizable characters, particularly when dealing with complex characters like Chinese. In such systems, characters are composed of intricate stroke patterns and spatial relationships that must be precisely maintained. We present GlyphMastero, a specialized glyph encoder designed to guide the latent diffusion model for generating texts with stroke-level precision. Our key insight is that existing methods, despite using pretrained OCR models for feature extraction, fail to capture the hierarchical nature of text structures - from individual strokes to stroke-level interactions to overall character-level structure. To address this, our glyph encoder explicitly models and captures the cross-level interactions between local-level individual characters and global-level text lines through our novel glyph attention module. Meanwhile, our model implements a feature pyramid network to fuse the multi-scale OCR backbone features at the global-level. Through these cross-level and multi-scale fusions, we obtain more detailed glyph-aware guidance, enabling precise control over the scene text generation process.

While the robustness of EOT couplings/maps makes them a go-to choice in practical applications, EOT solvers remain difficult to tune because of a small but influential set of hyperparameters, notably the omnipresent entropic regularization strength $\varepsilon$. Setting $\varepsilon$ can be difficult, as it simultaneously impacts various performance metrics, such as compute speed, statistical performance, generalization, and bias. In this work, we propose a new class of EOT solvers (ProgOT), that can estimate both plans and transport maps.We take advantage of several opportunities to optimize the computation of EOT solutions by *dividing* mass displacement using a time discretization, borrowing inspiration from dynamic OT formulations, and *conquering* each of these steps using EOT with properly scheduled parameters. We provide experimental evidence demonstrating that ProgOT is a faster and more robust alternative to *standard solvers* when computing couplings at large scales, even outperforming neural network-based approaches.

To address these limitations, this paper introduces Selective Feature Imputation for Debiasing (SFID), a novel methodology that integrates feature pruning and low confidence imputation (LCI) to effectively reduce biases in VLMs. SFID is versatile, maintaining the semantic integrity of outputs and costly effective by eliminating the need for retraining. Our experimental results demonstrate SFID's effectiveness across various VLMs tasks including zero-shot classification, text-to-image retrieval, image captioning, and text-to-image generation, by significantly reducing gender biases without compromising performance.

Enhancing Large Language Models' Situated Faithfulness to External Contexts,"Yukun Huang, Sanxing Chen, Hongyi Cai, Bhuwan Dhingra","Large Language Models (LLMs) are often augmented with external contexts, such as those used in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). However, these contexts can be inaccurate or intentionally misleading, leading to conflicts with the model’s internal knowledge. We argue that robust LLMs should demonstrate situated faithfulness, dynamically calibrating their trust in external information based on their confidence in the internal knowledge and the external context to resolve knowledge conflicts. To benchmark this capability, we evaluate LLMs across several QA datasets, including a newly created dataset featuring in-the-wild incorrect contexts sourced from Reddit posts. We show that when provided with both correct and incorrect contexts, both open-source and proprietary models tend to overly rely on external information, regardless of its factual accuracy. To enhance situated faithfulness, we propose two approaches: Self-Guided Confidence Reasoning (SCR) and Rule-Based Confidence Reasoning (RCR). SCR enables models to self-access the confidence of external information relative to their own internal knowledge to produce the most accurate answer. RCR, in contrast, extracts explicit confidence signals from the LLM and determines the final answer using predefined rules. 
Our results show that for LLMs with strong reasoning capabilities, such as GPT-4o and GPT-4o mini, SCR outperforms RCR, achieving improvements of up to 24.2\% over a direct input augmentation baseline. Conversely, for a smaller model like Llama-3-8B, RCR outperforms SCR. Fine-tuning SCR with our proposed Confidence Reasoning Direct Preference Optimization (CR-DPO) method improves performance on both seen and unseen datasets, yielding an average improvement of 8.9\% on Llama-3-8B.

Current Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), constrained by their training data, lack the capability to function effectively as operation assistants. Instead, MLLM-based agents, which enhance capabilities through tool invocation, are gradually being applied to this scenario. However, the two major navigation challenges in mobile device operation tasks — task progress navigation and focus content navigation — are difficult to effectively solve under the single-agent architecture of existing work. This is due to the overly long token sequences and the interleaved text-image data format, which limit performance. To address these navigation challenges effectively, we propose Mobile-Agent-v2, a multi-agent architecture for mobile device operation assistance. The architecture comprises three agents: planning agent, decision agent, and reflection agent. The planning agent condenses lengthy, interleaved image-text history operations and screens summaries into a pure-text task progress, which is then passed on to the decision agent. This reduction in context length makes it easier for decision agent to navigate the task progress. To retain focus content, we design a memory unit that updates with task progress by decision agent. Additionally, to correct erroneous operations, the reflection agent observes the outcomes of each operation and handles any mistake accordingly. Experimental results indicate that Mobile-Agent-v2 achieves over a 30% improvement in task completion compared to the single-agent architecture of Mobile-Agent.

Here, the loss function poses the bottleneck when training a deep neural network. We present Newton Losses, a method for improving the performance of existing hard to optimize losses by exploiting their second-order information via their empirical Fisher and Hessian matrices. Instead of training the neural network with second-order techniques, we only utilize the loss function's second-order information to replace it by a Newton Loss, while training the network with gradient descent.  This makes our method computationally efficient.

The key idea is to leverage the ViL model as a proxy to facilitate the adaptation process towards the latent domain-invariant space. Concretely, we design a proxy denoising mechanism to correct ViL's predictions. This is grounded on a proxy confidence theory that models the dynamic effect of proxy's divergence against the domain-invariant space during adaptation. To capitalize the corrected proxy, we further derive a mutual knowledge distilling regularization. Extensive experiments show that ProDe significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art alternatives under both conventional closed-set setting and the more challenging open-set, partial-set, generalized SFDA, multi-target, multi-source, and test-time settings.

To uncover potential security risks, attacking the safety-critical task of person detection has garnered significant attention. However, we observe that existing attack methods overlook the pivotal role of the camera, involving capturing real-world scenes and converting them into digital images, in the physical adversarial attack workflow. This oversight leads to instability and challenges in reproducing these attacks. In this work, we revisit patch-based attacks against person detectors and introduce a camera-agnostic physical adversarial attack to mitigate this limitation. Specifically, we construct a differentiable camera Image Signal Processing (ISP) proxy network to compensate for the physical-to-digital transition gap. Furthermore, the camera ISP proxy network serves as a defense module, forming an adversarial optimization framework with the attack module. The attack module optimizes adversarial patches to maximize effectiveness, while the defense module optimizes the conditional parameters of the camera ISP proxy network to minimize attack effectiveness. These modules engage in an adversarial game, enhancing cross-camera stability. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed Camera-Agnostic Patch (CAP) attack effectively conceals persons from detectors across various imaging hardware, including two distinct cameras and four smartphones.",2024-12-16,4,NeurIPS

In contrast, linear RNNs have low computational complexity and are suitable for long-range modeling. Toward this goal, we propose a simple and effective window-based framework built on Linear group RNN (i.e., perform linear RNN for grouped features) for accurate 3D object detection, called LION. The key property is to allow sufficient feature interaction in a much larger group than transformer-based methods. However, effectively applying linear group RNN to 3D object detection in highly sparse point clouds is not trivial due to its limitation in handling spatial modeling. To tackle this problem, we simply introduce a 3D spatial feature descriptor and integrate it into the linear group RNN operators to enhance their spatial features rather than blindly increasing the number of scanning orders for voxel features. To further address the challenge in highly sparse point clouds, we propose a 3D voxel generation strategy to densify foreground features thanks to linear group RNN as a natural property of auto-regressive models. Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness of the proposed components and the generalization of our LION on different linear group RNN operators including Mamba, RWKV, and RetNet. Furthermore, it is worth mentioning that our LION-Mamba achieves state-of-the-art on Waymo, nuScenes, Argoverse V2, and ONCE datasets. Last but not least, our method supports kinds of advanced linear RNN operators (e.g., RetNet, RWKV, Mamba, xLSTM and TTT) on small but popular KITTI dataset for a quick experience with our linear RNN-based framework.",2024-12-16,23,NeurIPS

In such applications, camera-based perception enables the extraction of additional modalities (human pose, text) to enhance prediction accuracy. Indeed, we find that textual descriptions play a crucial role in integrating additional modalities into a unified understanding. However, online extraction of text requires the use of VLM, which may not be feasible for resource-constrained systems. To address this challenge, we propose a multi-modal knowledge distillation framework: a student model with limited modality is distilled from a teacher model trained with full range of modalities. The comprehensive knowledge of a teacher model trained with trajectory, human pose, and text is distilled into a student model using only trajectory or human pose as a sole supplement. In doing so, we separately distill the core locomotion insights from intra-agent multi-modality and inter-agent interaction. Our generalizable framework is validated with two state-of-the-art models across three datasets on both ego-view (JRDB, SIT) and BEV-view (ETH/UCY) setups, utilizing both annotated and VLM-generated text captions. Distilled student models show consistent improvement in all prediction metrics for both full and instantaneous observations, improving up to ~13%.

Much like speakers who might produce awkward expressions when learning a second language, LLMs often generate unnatural outputs in non-English languages, reflecting English-centric patterns in both vocabulary and grammar. Despite the importance of this issue, the naturalness of multilingual LLM outputs has received limited attention. In this paper, we address this gap by introducing novel automatic corpus-level metrics to assess the lexical and syntactic naturalness of LLM outputs in a multilingual context. Using our new metrics, we evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs on a curated benchmark in French and Chinese, revealing a tendency towards English-influenced patterns. To mitigate this issue, we also propose a simple and effective alignment method to improve the naturalness of an LLM in a target language and domain, achieving consistent improvements in naturalness without compromising the performance on general-purpose benchmarks.

It was inspired by Bayesian learning, which allows sequential data processing and naturally turns posteriors from one processing step into priors for the next. However, despite two and a half decades of research, the ability to update priors sequentially without losing confidence information along the way remained elusive for PAC-Bayes. While PAC-Bayes allows construction of data-informed priors, the final confidence intervals depend only on the number of points that were not used for the construction of the prior, whereas confidence information in the prior, which is related to the number of points used to construct the prior, is lost. This limits the possibility and benefit of sequential prior updates, because the final bounds depend only on the size of the final batch.We present a novel and, in retrospect, surprisingly simple and powerful PAC-Bayesian procedure that allows  sequential prior updates with no information loss. The procedure is based on a novel decomposition of the expected loss of randomized classifiers. The decomposition rewrites the loss of the posterior as an excess loss relative to a downscaled loss of the prior plus the downscaled loss of the prior, which is bounded recursively. As a side result, we also present a generalization of the split-kl and PAC-Bayes-split-kl inequalities to discrete random variables, which we use for bounding the excess losses, and which can be of independent interest. In empirical evaluation the new procedure significantly outperforms state-of-the-art.",2024-12-16,4,NeurIPS

Our approach first utilizes a transformer-based tokenizer to produce refined latent representations of the intermediate frames for diffusion models. We then enhance the diffusion transformer with temporal attention across the process and incorporate a start-end frame difference embedding to guide the generation of dynamic motion.

Although Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is widely used to efficiently acquire specialized knowledge in MLLMs, it introduces substantial harmful redundancy during visual instruction tuning, which exacerbates the forgetting of general knowledge and degrades downstream task performance. To address this issue, we propose LoRASculpt to eliminate harmful redundant parameters, thereby harmonizing general and specialized knowledge. Specifically, under theoretical guarantees, we introduce sparse updates into LoRA to discard redundant parameters effectively. Furthermore, we propose a Conflict Mitigation Regularizer to refine the update trajectory of LoRA, mitigating knowledge conflicts with the pretrained weights.

However, no machine-learning-ready dataset has integrated geostationary satellite data with fine-grained solar radiation information to support forecasting model development and benchmarking with consistent metrics.

These models typically leverage reconstructive autoencoders like VQGAN or VAE to encode pixels into a more compact latent space and learn the data distribution in the latent space instead of directly from pixels. However, this practice raises a pertinent question: Is it truly the optimal choice? In response, we begin with an intriguing observation: despite sharing the same latent space, autoregressive models significantly lag behind LDMs and MIMs in image generation. This finding contrasts sharply with the field of NLP, where the autoregressive model GPT has established a commanding presence. To address this discrepancy, we introduce a unified perspective on the relationship between latent space and generative models, emphasizing the stability of latent space in image generative modeling. Furthermore, we propose a simple but effective discrete image tokenizer to stabilize the latent space for image generative modeling by applying K-Means on the latent features of self-supervised learning models. Experimental results show that image autoregressive modeling with our tokenizer (DiGIT) benefits both image understanding and image generation with the next token prediction principle, which is inherently straightforward for GPT models but challenging for other generative models. Remarkably, for the first time, a GPT-style autoregressive model for images outperforms LDMs, which also exhibits substantial improvement akin to GPT when scaling up model size. Our findings underscore the potential of an optimized latent space and the integration of discrete tokenization in advancing the capabilities of image generative models.

Graph self-supervised pre-training, which trains GNN encoders without manual labels to generate high-quality graph representations, has garnered widespread attention. However, due to the inherent complex characteristics in graphs, GNNs encoders pre-trained on one dataset struggle to directly adapt to others that have different node feature shapes. This typically necessitates either model rebuilding or data alignment. The former results in non-transferability as each dataset need to rebuild a new model, while the latter brings serious knowledge loss since it forces features into a uniform shape by preprocessing such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA). To address this challenge, we propose a new Feature-Universal Graph contrastive pre-training strategy (FUG) that naturally avoids the need for model rebuilding and data reshaping. Specifically, inspired by discussions in existing work on the relationship between contrastive Learning and PCA, we conducted a theoretical analysis and discovered that PCA's optimization objective is a special case of that in contrastive Learning. We designed an encoder with contrastive constraints to emulate PCA's generation of basis transformation matrix, which is utilized to losslessly adapt features in different datasets. Furthermore, we introduced a global uniformity constraint to replace negative sampling, reducing the time complexity from $O(n^2)$ to $O(n)$, and by explicitly defining positive samples, FUG avoids the substantial memory requirements of data augmentation.

Previous MLLM-based methods commonly struggle with the dilemma between ""Ref"" and ""VOS"": they either specialize in understanding a few key frames (global reasoning) or tracking objects on continuous frames (local reasoning), and rely on external VOS or frame selectors to mitigate the other end of the challenge. However, our framework GLUS shows that global and local consistency can be unified into a single video segmentation MLLM: a set of sparse ""context frames"" provides global information, while a stream of continuous ""query frames"" conducts local object tracking. This is further supported by jointly training the MLLM with a pre-trained VOS memory bank to simultaneously digest short-range and long-range temporal information. To improve the information efficiency within the limited context window of MLLMs, we introduce object contrastive learning to distinguish hard false-positive objects and a self-refined framework to identify crucial frames and perform propagation. By collectively integrating these insights, our GLUS delivers a simple yet effective baseline, achieving new state-of-the-art for MLLMs on the MeViS and Ref-Youtube-VOS benchmark.

However, this approach neglects the steady progression of \textit{open-source} models. As open-source models advance in capability, ensuring their safety becomes increasingly imperative. Yet, attacks tailored to open-source LLMs that exploit full model access remain largely unexplored. We address this research gap and propose the \textit{embedding space attack}, which directly attacks the \textit{continuous} embedding representation of input tokens.We find that embedding space attacks circumvent model alignments and trigger harmful behaviors more efficiently than discrete attacks or model fine-tuning. Additionally, we demonstrate that models compromised by embedding attacks can be used to create discrete jailbreaks in natural language. Lastly, we present a novel threat model in the context of unlearning and show that embedding space attacks can extract supposedly deleted information from unlearned LLMs across multiple datasets and models.

To ensure this progress, it is important to understand the potential pitfalls on the way from a novel method's success on academic benchmarks to its practical deployment. In this work, we analyze existing tabular deep learning benchmarks and find two common characteristics of tabular data in typical industrial applications that are underrepresented in the datasets usually used for evaluation in the literature.
First, in real-world deployment scenarios, distribution of data often changes over time. To account for this distribution drift, time-based train/test splits should be used in evaluation. However, existing academic tabular datasets often lack timestamp metadata to enable such evaluation.
Second, a considerable portion of datasets in production settings stem from extensive data acquisition and feature engineering pipelines. This can have an impact on the absolute and relative number of predictive, uninformative, and correlated features compared to academic datasets.
In this work, we aim to understand how recent research advances in tabular deep learning transfer to these underrepresented conditions.
To this end, we introduce TabReD -- a collection of eight industry-grade tabular datasets. 
We reassess a large number of tabular ML models and techniques on TabReD. We demonstrate that evaluation on both time-based data splits and richer feature sets leads to different methods ranking, compared to evaluation on random splits and smaller number of features, which are common in academic benchmarks. Furthermore, simple MLP-like architectures and GBDT show the best results on the TabReD datasets, while other methods are less effective in the new setting.",2024-10-04,8,ICLR

Recent studies disclose knowledge conflicts in LLM generation, wherein outdated or incorrect parametric knowledge (i.e., encoded knowledge) contradicts new knowledge provided in the context. To mitigate such knowledge conflicts, we propose a novel framework, IRCAN (Identifying and Reweighting Context-Aware Neurons) to capitalize on neurons that are crucial in processing contextual cues. Specifically, IRCAN first identifies neurons that significantly contribute to context processing, utilizing a context-aware attribution score derived from integrated gradients. Subsequently, the identified context-aware neurons are strengthened via reweighting. In doing so, we steer LLMs to generate context-sensitive outputs with respect to the new knowledge provided in the context. Extensive experiments conducted across a variety of models and tasks demonstrate that IRCAN not only achieves remarkable improvements in handling knowledge conflicts but also offers a scalable, plug-and-play solution that can be integrated seamlessly with existing models.

A logical regularization termed L-Reg is derived which bridges a logical analysis framework to image classification. Our work reveals that L-Reg reduces the complexity of the model in terms of the feature distribution and classifier weights. Specifically, we unveil the interpretability brought by L-Reg, as it enables the model to extract the salient features, such as faces to persons, for classification. Theoretical analysis and experiments demonstrate that L-Reg enhances generalization across various scenarios, including multi-domain generalization and generalized category discovery. In complex real-world scenarios where images span unknown classes and unseen domains, L-Reg consistently improves generalization, highlighting its practical efficacy.",2024-12-16,4,NeurIPS

Factors limiting time series diffusion models include insufficient time series datasets and the absence of guidance. To address these limitations, we propose a Retrieval-Augmented Time series Diffusion model (RATD). The framework of RATD consists of two parts: an embedding-based retrieval process and a reference-guided diffusion model. In the first part, RATD retrieves the time series that are most relevant to historical time series from the database as references. The references are utilized to guide the denoising process in the second part. Our approach allows leveraging meaningful samples within the database to aid in sampling, thus maximizing the utilization of datasets. Meanwhile, this reference-guided mechanism also compensates for the deficiencies of existing time series diffusion models in terms of guidance.

Our approach uniquely combines 3D generative models for digital twin creation, vision foundation models for semantic feature extraction, and robust pose tracking for continuous semantic flow updates. This integration enables complete semantic understanding even under occlusions while eliminating manual annotation requirements. By incorporating semantic flow into diffusion policies, we demonstrate significant improvements in both terminal-constrained manipulation and cross-object generalization. Extensive experiments across five simulation tasks show that G3Flow consistently outperforms existing approaches, achieving up to 68.3% and 50.1% average success rates on terminal-constrained manipulation and cross-object generalization tasks respectively.

Previous methods typically use a fixed-length and sufficiently long trajectory of an agent as observations to predict its future trajectory. However, in real-world scenarios, we often lack the time to gather enough trajectory points before making predictions, e.g., when a car suddenly appears due to an obstruction, the system must make immediate predictions to prevent a collision. This poses a new challenge for trajectory prediction systems, requiring them to be capable of making accurate predictions based on observed trajectories of arbitrary lengths, leading to the failure of existing methods. In this paper, we propose a Length-agnostic Knowledge Distillation framework, named LaKD,  which can make accurate trajectory predictions, regardless of the length of observed data. Specifically, considering the fact that long trajectories, containing richer temporal information but potentially additional interference, may perform better or worse than short trajectories, we devise a dynamic length-agnostic knowledge distillation mechanism for exchanging information among trajectories of arbitrary lengths, dynamically determining the transfer direction based on prediction performance. In contrast to traditional knowledge distillation, LaKD employs a unique model that simultaneously serves as both the teacher and the student, potentially causing knowledge collision during the distillation process. Therefore, we design a dynamic soft-masking mechanism, where we first calculate the importance of neuron units and then apply soft-masking to them, so as to safeguard critical units from disruption during the knowledge distillation process. In essence, LaKD is a general and principled framework that can be naturally compatible with existing trajectory prediction models of different architectures. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets, Argoverse 1, nuScenes and Argoverse 2, demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.",2024-12-16,5,NeurIPS

Research in machine-generated text detection is however mostly focused on the English language and longer texts, such as news articles, scientific papers or student essays. Social-media texts are usually much shorter and often feature informal language, grammatical errors, or distinct linguistic items (e.g., emoticons, hashtags). There is a gap in studying the ability of existing methods in detection of such texts, reflected also in the lack of existing multilingual benchmark datasets. To fill this gap we propose the first multilingual (22 languages) and multi-platform (5 social media platforms) dataset for benchmarking machine-generated text detection in the social-media domain, called MultiSocial. It contains 472,097 texts, of which about 58k are human-written and approximately the same amount is generated by each of 7 multilingual LLMs. We use this benchmark to compare existing detection methods in zero-shot as well as fine-tuned form.

Recent theory has shown that seeking the deep models, whose parameters lie in the flat minima of the loss landscape, can significantly reduce the out-of-domain generalization error. However, existing methods often neglect the consistency of loss landscapes in different domains, resulting in models that are not simultaneously in the optimal flat minima in all domains, which limits their generalization ability. To address this issue, this paper proposes an iterative Self-Feedback Training (SFT) framework to seek consistent flat minima that are shared across different domains by progressively refining loss landscapes during training. It alternatively generates a feedback signal by measuring the inconsistency of loss landscapes in different domains and refines these loss landscapes for greater consistency using this feedback signal. Benefiting from the consistency of the flat minima within these refined loss landscapes, our SFT helps achieve better out-of-domain generalization. Extensive experiments on DomainBed demonstrate superior performances of SFT when compared to state-of-the-art sharpness-aware methods and other prevalent DG baselines. On average across five DG benchmarks, SFT surpasses the sharpness-aware minimization by 2.6% with ResNet-50 and 1.5% with ViT-B/16, respectively. The code will be available soon.",2025-06-01,2,CVPR

Lin, Pengcheng Weng, Yinqiao Wang, Han Ding, Jinsong Han, Fei Wang","LiDAR point cloud semantic segmentation plays a crucial role in autonomous driving. In recent years, semi-supervised methods have gained popularity due to their significant reduction in annotation labor and time costs. Current semi-supervised methods typically focus on point cloud spatial distribution or consider short-term temporal representations, e.g., only two adjacent frames, often overlooking the rich long-term temporal properties inherent in autonomous driving scenarios. In driving experience, we observe that nearby objects, such as roads and vehicles, remain stable while driving, whereas distant objects exhibit greater variability in category and shape. This natural phenomenon is also captured by LiDAR, which reflects lower temporal sensitivity for nearby objects and higher sensitivity for distant ones. To leverage these characteristics, we propose HiLoTs, which learns high-temporal sensitivity and low-temporal sensitivity representations from continuous LiDAR frames.

However, the current video generation models predominantly focus on single-prompt, struggling to generate coherent scenes with multiple sequential prompts that better reflect real-world dynamic scenarios. While some pioneering works have explored multi-prompt video generation, they face significant challenges including strict training data requirements, weak prompt following, and unnatural transitions. To address these problems, we propose DiTCtrl, a training-free multi-prompt video generation method under MM-DiT architectures for the first time. Our key idea is to take the multi-prompt video generation task as temporal video editing with smooth transitions. To achieve this goal, we first analyze MM-DiT's attention mechanism, finding that the 3D full attention behaves similarly to that of the cross/self-attention blocks in the UNet-like diffusion models, enabling mask-guided precise semantic control across different prompts with attention sharing for multi-prompt video generation. Based on our careful design, the video generated by DiTCtrl achieves smooth transitions and consistent object motion given multiple sequential prompts without additional training. Besides, we also present MPVBench, a new benchmark specially designed for multi-prompt video generation to evaluate the performance of multi-prompt generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance without additional training.",2025-06-01,25,CVPR

Numerous imaging and vision techniques have leveraged event cameras for high-speed scene understanding by capturing high-framerate, high-dynamic range videos, primarily utilizing the temporal advantages inherent to event cameras. Additionally, imaging and vision techniques have utilized the light field-a complementary dimension to temporal information-for enhanced scene understanding. In this work, we propose ""Event Fields"", a new approach that utilizes innovative optical designs for event cameras to capture light fields at high speed. We develop the underlying mathematical framework for Event Fields and introduce two foundational frameworks to capture them practically: spatial multiplexing to capture temporal derivatives and temporal multiplexing to capture angular derivatives. To realize these, we design two complementary optical setups one using a kaleidoscope for spatial multiplexing and another using a galvanometer for temporal multiplexing. We evaluate the performance of both designs using a custom-built simulator and real hardware prototypes, showcasing their distinct benefits. Our event fields unlock the full advantages of typical light fields-like post-capture refocusing and depth estimation-now supercharged for high-speed and high-dynamic range scenes.

Current methods encounter challenges in effectively modeling crack morphology and texture, facing challenges in balancing segmentation quality with low computational resource usage. To overcome these limitations, we propose a lightweight Structure-Aware Vision Mamba Network (SCSegamba), capable of generating high-quality pixel-level segmentation maps by leveraging both the morphological information and texture cues of crack pixels with minimal computational cost. Specifically, we developed a Structure-Aware Visual State Space module (SAVSS), which incorporates a lightweight Gated Bottleneck Convolution (GBC) and a Structure-Aware Scanning Strategy (SASS). The key insight of GBC lies in its effectiveness in modeling the morphological information of cracks, while the SASS enhances the perception of crack topology and texture by strengthening the continuity of semantic information between crack pixels. Experiments on crack benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, achieving the highest performance with only 2.8M parameters.

Diffusion transformers (DiTs), like SD3, are emerging as a promising alternative because of their better quality with scalability. In this paper, we introduce DPIR (Dual Prompting Image Restoration), a novel image restoration method that effectivly extracts conditional information of low-quality images from multiple perspectives. Specifically, DPIR consits of two branches: a low-quality image conditioning branch and a dual prompting control branch. The first branch utilizes a lightweight module to incorporate image priors into the DiT with high efficiency. More importantly, we believe that in image restoration, textual description alone cannot fully capture its rich visual characteristics. Therefore, a dual prompting module is designed to provide DiT with additional visual cues, capturing both global context and local appearance. The extracted global-local visual prompts as extra conditional control, alongside textual prompts to form dual prompts, greatly enhance the quality of the restoration.

However, the robustness of these models remains scarcely explored. Contrary to computer vision, there are no effective attacks to properly evaluate the adversarial robustness of deep tabular models due to intrinsic properties of tabular data, such as categorical features, immutability, and feature relationship constraints. To fill this gap, we first propose CAPGD, a gradient attack that overcomes the failures of existing gradient attacks with adaptive mechanisms. This new attack does not require parameter tuning and further degrades the accuracy, up to 81\% points compared to the previous gradient attacks. Second, we design CAA, an efficient evasion attack that combines our CAPGD attack and MOEVA, the best search-based attack.  We demonstrate the effectiveness of our attacks on five architectures and four critical use cases. Our empirical study demonstrates that CAA outperforms all existing attacks in 17 over the 20 settings, and leads to a drop in the accuracy by up to 96.1\% points and 21.9\% points compared to CAPGD and MOEVA respectively while being up to five times faster than MOEVA.

To address this issue, we propose a Distribution Prototype Diffusion Learning (DPDL) method aimed at enclosing normal samples within a compact and discriminative distribution space. Specifically, we construct multiple learnable Gaussian prototypes to create a latent representation space for abundant and diverse normal samples and learn a Schrödinger bridge to facilitate a diffusive transition toward these prototypes for normal samples while steering anomaly samples away. Moreover, to enhance inter-sample separation, we design a dispersion feature learning way in hyperspherical space, which benefits the identification of out-of-distribution anomalies.

In this paper, we propose FreeGave to learn the physics of complex dynamic 3D scenes without needing any object priors. The key to our approach is to introduce a physics code followed by a carefully designed divergence-free module for estimating a per-Gaussian velocity field, without relying on the inefficient PINN losses.

Despite recent efforts, the sample complexity of RMDPs has remained largely undetermined. While the statistical implications of distributional robustness in RL have been explored in some specific cases, the generalizability of the existing findings remains unclear, especially in comparison to standard RL.  Assuming access to a generative model that samples from the nominal MDP, we examine the sample complexity of RMDPs using a class of generalized $L_p$ norms as the 'distance' function for the uncertainty set, under two commonly adopted $sa$-rectangular and $s$-rectangular conditions. Our results imply that RMDPs can be more sample-efficient to solve than standard MDPs using generalized $L_p$ norms in both $sa$- and $s$-rectangular cases, potentially inspiring more empirical research. We provide a near-optimal upper bound and a matching minimax lower bound for the $sa$-rectangular scenarios.

In this work, we address the challenge of generating photorealistic mirror reflections using diffusion-based generative models. Despite extensive training data, existing diffusion models frequently overlook the nuanced details crucial to authentic mirror reflections. Recent approaches have attempted to resolve this by creating synhetic datasets and framing reflection generation as an inpainting task; however, they struggle to generalize across different object orientations and positions relative to the mirror. Our method overcomes these limitations by introducing key augmentations into the synthetic data pipeline: (1) random object positioning, (2) randomized rotations, and (3) grounding of objects, significantly enhancing generalization across poses and placements. To further address spatial relationships and occlusions in scenes with multiple objects, we implement a strategy to pair objects during dataset generation, resulting in a dataset robust enough to handle these complex scenarios. Achieving generalization to real-world scenes remains a challenge, so we introduce a three-stage training curriculum to develop the MirrorFusion 2.0 model to improve real-world performance.

Existing data valuation methods define a value for a discrete dataset. However, in many use cases, users are interested in not only the value of the dataset, but that of the distribution from which the dataset was sampled. For example, consider a buyer trying to evaluate whether to purchase data from different vendors. The buyer may observe (and compare) only a small preview sample from each vendor, to decide which vendor's data distribution is most useful to the buyer and purchase. The core question is how should we compare the values of data distributions from their samples? Under a Huber characterization of the data heterogeneity across vendors, we propose a maximum mean discrepancy (MMD)-based valuation method which enables theoretically principled and actionable policies for comparing data distributions from samples. We empirically demonstrate that our method is sample-efficient and effective in identifying valuable data distributions against several existing baselines, on multiple real-world datasets (e.g., network intrusion detection, credit card fraud detection) and downstream applications (classification, regression).",2024-12-16,4,NeurIPS

The LingOly benchmark covers more than 90 mostly low-resource languages, minimising issues of data contamination, and contains 1,133 problems across 6 formats and 5 levels of human difficulty. We assess performance with both direct accuracy and comparison to a no-context baseline to penalise memorisation.

However, LLMs often generate unfaithful explanations, partly because they do not consistently adhere closely to the provided context. Existing approaches to this problem either rely on superficial calibration methods, such as decomposed Chain-of-Thought prompting, or require costly retraining to improve model faithfulness. In this work, we propose a probabilistic inference paradigm that leverages task-specific and lookahead rewards to ensure that LLM-generated rationales are more faithful to model decisions and align better with input context. These rewards are derived from a domain-specific proposal distribution, allowing for optimized sequential Monte Carlo approximations. Our evaluations across three different reasoning tasks show that this method, which allows for controllable generation during inference, improves both accuracy and faithfulness of LLMs. This method offers a promising path towards making LLMs more reliable for reasoning tasks without sacrificing performance.",2025-07-01,3,ACL

Yet their stochastic nature hinders artists from creating consistent images of the same subject. Existing methods try to tackle this challenge and generate consistent content in various ways. However, they either depend on external restricted data or require expensive tuning of the diffusion model. For this issue, we propose a novel one-shot tuning paradigm, termed OneActor. It efficiently performs consistent subject generation solely driven by prompts via a learned semantic guidance to bypass the laborious backbone tuning. We lead the way to formalize the objective of consistent subject generation from a clustering perspective, and thus design a cluster-conditioned model. To mitigate the overfitting challenge shared by one-shot tuning pipelines, we augment the tuning with auxiliary samples and devise two inference strategies: semantic interpolation and cluster guidance. These techniques are later verified to significantly improve the generation quality. Comprehensive experiments show that our method outperforms a variety of baselines with satisfactory subject consistency, superior prompt conformity as well as high image quality. Our method is capable of multi-subject generation and compatible with popular diffusion extensions. Besides, we achieve a $4\times$ faster tuning speed than tuning-based baselines and, if desired, avoid increasing the inference time. Furthermore, our method can be naturally utilized to pre-train a consistent subject generation network from scratch, which will implement this research task into more practical applications.

Therefore, we propose ICT, a lightweight, training-free method that calculates an intervention direction to shift the model's focus towards different levels of visual information, enhancing its attention to high-level and fine-grained visual details. During the forward pass stage, the intervention is applied to the attention heads that encode the overall image information and the fine-grained object details, effectively mitigating the phenomenon of overly language priors, and thereby alleviating hallucinations.

Comparing these maps of syntactically related tokens provides insights into how well the generated image reflects the text prompt. For example, in the prompt, ""a black car and a white clock"", the cross-attention maps for ""black"" and ""car"" should focus on overlapping regions to depict a black car, while ""car"" and ""clock"" should not. Incorrect overlapping in the maps generally produces generation flaws such as missing objects and incorrect attribute binding. Our study makes the key observations investigating this issue in the existing text-to-image models:(1) the similarity in text embeddings between different tokens -- used as conditioning inputs -- can cause their cross-attention maps to focus on the same image regions; and (2) text embeddings often fail to faithfully capture syntactic relations already within text attention maps. As a result, such syntactic relationships can be overlooked in cross-attention module, leading to inaccurate image generation. To address this, we propose a method that directly transfers syntactic relations from the text attention maps to the cross-attention module via a test-time optimization. Our approach leverages this inherent yet unexploited information within text attention maps to enhance image-text semantic alignment across diverse prompts, without relying on external guidance.",2025-06-01,3,CVPR

However, the existence of noisy preferences (NPs), where the responses are mistakenly labelled as chosen or rejected, could spoil the alignment, thus making the LLMs generate useless and even malicious content. Existing methods mitigate the issue of NPs from the loss perspective by adjusting the alignment loss based on a clean validation dataset.Orthogonal to these loss-oriented methods, we propose perplexity-aware correction (PerpCorrect) from the data perspective for robust alignment which detects and corrects NPs based on the differences between the perplexity of the chosen and rejected responses (dubbed as PPLDiff). Intuitively, a higher PPLDiff indicates a higher probability of the NP because a rejected/chosen response which is mistakenly labelled as chosen/rejected is less preferable to be generated by an aligned LLM, thus having a higher/lower perplexity.PerpCorrect works in three steps: (1) PerpCorrect aligns a surrogate LLM using the clean validation data to make the PPLDiff able to distinguish clean preferences (CPs) and NPs. (2) PerpCorrect further aligns the surrogate LLM by incorporating the reliable clean training data whose PPLDiff is extremely small and reliable noisy training data whose PPLDiff is extremely large after correction to boost the discriminatory power.(3) Detecting and correcting NPs according to the PPLDiff obtained by the aligned surrogate LLM to obtain a denoised training dataset for robust alignment.Comprehensive experiments validate that our proposed PerpCorrect can achieve state-of-the-art alignment performance under NPs.Notably, PerpCorrect demonstrates practical utility by requiring only a modest amount of validation data and being compatible with various alignment techniques.

Recent work shows that ICL emerges when models are trained on a sufficiently diverse set of tasks and the transition from memorization to generalization is sharp with increasing task diversity. One interpretation is that a network's limited capacity to memorize favors generalization. Here, we examine the mechanistic underpinnings of this transition using a small transformer applied to a synthetic ICL task. Using theory and experiment, we show that the sub-circuits that memorize and generalize can be viewed as largely independent. The relative *rates* at which these sub-circuits learn explains the transition from memorization to generalization, rather than capacity constraints.

				923-931","Human Activity Recognition (HAR) aims to recognize activities by training models on massive sensor data. In real-world deployment, a crucial aspect of HAR that has been largely overlooked is that the test sets may have different distributions from training sets due to inter-subject variability including age, gender, behavioral habits, etc., which leads to poor generalization performance. One promising solution is to learn domain-invariant representations to enable a model to generalize on an unseen distribution. However, most existing methods only consider the feature-invariance of the penultimate layer for domain-invariant learning, which leads to suboptimal results. In this paper, we propose a Categorical Concept Invariant Learning (CCIL) framework for generalizable activity recognition, which introduces a concept matrix to regularize the model in the training stage by simultaneously concertrating on feature-invariance and logit-invariance. Our key idea is that the concept matrix for samples belonging to the same activity category should be similar. Extensive experiments on four public HAR benchmarks demonstrate that our CCIL substantially outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches under cross-person, cross-dataset, cross-position, and one-person-to-another settings.",2025-04-11,1,AAAI

In this paper, we introduce a multimodal generation framework that incorporates four major data modalities, including a novel addition of map modality. With tokenized modalities, our scene sequence generation framework autoregressively predicts each scene while managing computational demands through a two-stage approach. The Temporal AutoRegressive (TAR) component captures inter-frame dynamics for each modality while the Ordered AutoRegressive (OAR) component aligns modalities within each scene by sequentially predicting tokens in a fixed order. To maintain coherence between map and ego-action modalities, we introduce the Action-aware Map Alignment (AMA) module, which applies a transformation based on the ego-action to maintain coherence between these modalities. Our framework effectively generates complex, realistic driving scenes over extended sequences, ensuring multimodal consistency and offering fine-grained control over scene elements.

However, the quality and generalizability of 3D content generation remain limited. State-of-the-art methods often require large-scale 3D assets for training, which are challenging to collect. In this work, we introduce Kiss3DGen (Keep It Simple and Straightforward in 3D Generation), an efficient framework for generating, editing, and enhancing 3D objects by repurposing a well-trained 2D image diffusion model for 3D generation. Specifically, we fine-tune a diffusion model to generate ''3D Bundle Image'', a tiled representation composed of multi-view images and their corresponding normal maps. The normal maps are then used to reconstruct a 3D mesh, and the multi-view images provide texture mapping, resulting in a complete 3D model. This simple method effectively transforms the 3D generation problem into a 2D image generation task, maximizing the utilization of knowledge in pretrained diffusion models. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our Kiss3DGen model is compatible with various diffusion model techniques, enabling advanced features such as 3D editing, mesh and texture enhancement, etc. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, showcasing its ability to produce high-quality 3D models efficiently.",2025-06-01,6,CVPR

However, the extensive prior knowledge inherent in these models can sometimes be a double-edged sword when adapting them to downstream tasks in specific domains. In the context of semi-supervised medical image segmentation with domain shift, foundation models like MedSAM tend to make overconfident predictions, some of which are incorrect. The error accumulation hinders the effective utilization of unlabeled data and limits further improvements. In this paper, we introduce a Synergistic training framework for Foundation and Conventional models (SynFoC) to address the issue. We observe that a conventional model trained from scratch has the ability to correct the high-confidence mispredictions of the foundation model, while the foundation model can supervise it with high-quality pseudo-labels in the early training stages. Furthermore, to enhance the collaborative training effectiveness of both models and promote reliable convergence towards optimization, the consensus-divergence consistency regularization is proposed.

Although sensor fusion architectures enhance performance in challenging environments, they still suffer significant performance drops under severe sensor failures, such as LiDAR beam reduction, LiDAR drop, limited field of view, camera drop, and occlusion. This limitation stems from inter-modality dependencies in current sensor fusion frameworks. In this study, we introduce an efficient and robust LiDAR-camera 3D object detector, referred to as MoME, which can achieve robust performance through a mixture of experts approach. Our MoME fully decouples modality dependencies using three parallel expert decoders, which use camera features, LiDAR features, or a combination of both to decode object queries, respectively. We propose Multi-Expert Decoding (MED) framework, where each query is decoded selectively using one of three expert decoders. MoME utilizes an Adaptive Query Router (AQR) to select the most appropriate expert decoder for each query based on the quality of camera and LiDAR features. This ensures that each query is processed by the best-suited expert, resulting in robust performance across diverse sensor failure scenarios. We evaluated the performance of MoME on the nuScenes-R benchmark.

However, during feature extraction, individual samples are inevitably affected by noise (background, occlusions, and model limitations). Considering that features from the same identity follow a normal distribution around identity centers after training, we propose a Training-Free Feature Centralization ReID framework (Pose2ID) by aggregating the same identity features to reduce individual noise and enhance the stability of identity representation, which preserves the feature's original distribution for following strategies such as re-ranking. Specifically, to obtain samples of the same identity, we introduce two components: Identity-Guided Pedestrian Generation: by leveraging identity features to guide the generation process, we obtain high-quality images with diverse poses, ensuring identity consistency even in complex scenarios such as infrared, and occlusion. Neighbor Feature Centralization: it explores each sample's potential positive samples from its neighborhood. Experiments demonstrate that our generative model exhibits strong generalization capabilities and maintains high identity consistency. With the Feature Centralization framework, we achieve impressive performance even with an ImageNet pre-trained model without ReID training, reaching mAP/Rank-1 of 52.81/78.92 on Market1501.

Concretely, we first manually segment the image into semantically meaningful regions (i.e., semantic segmentation mask) according to common-object vocabulary, while also distinguishing attributes of objects within all those regions. Then directional relation labels of these objects are annotated to compose a directed scene graph that can well encode rich compositional information of the image. Based on our directed scene graph, we develop a pipeline to assess the generated detailed captions from LVLMs on multiple levels, including the object-level coverage, the accuracy of attribute descriptions, the score of key relationships, etc. Experimental results on the CompreCap dataset confirm that our evaluation method aligns closely with human evaluation scores across LVLMs.",2025-06-01,12,CVPR

In line with the philosophy of future is a continuation of past, we propose BridgeAD, which reformulates motion and planning queries as multi-step queries to differentiate the queries for each future time step. This design enables the effective use of historical prediction and planning by applying them to the appropriate parts of the end-to-end system based on the time steps, which improves both perception and motion planning. Specifically, historical queries for the current frame are combined with perception, while queries for future frames are integrated with motion planning. In this way, we bridge the gap between past and future by aggregating historical insights at every time step, enhancing the overall coherence and accuracy of the end-to-end autonomous driving pipeline.

Within our two stage learning scheme, we first learn a set of primitive prompts to represent shared primitives through multi-skills pre-training stage, where motion-aware prompts are learned to capture semantic and motion shared primitives across different skills.

However, the disentanglement is challenging due to the complexity of glyphs, often resulting in glyphs that are influenced by the style of the source glyph and prone to artifacts. We propose IF-Font, a novel paradigm which incorporates Ideographic Description Sequence (IDS) instead of the source glyph to control the semantics of generated glyphs. To achieve this, we quantize the reference glyphs into tokens, and model the token distribution of target glyphs using corresponding IDS and reference tokens. The proposed method excels in synthesizing glyphs with neat and correct strokes, and enables the creation of new glyphs based on provided IDS.

We show that the best-of-$n$ sampling distribution is essentially equivalent to the policy learned by RLHF if we apply a particular monotone transformation to the reward function. Moreover, we show that this transformation yields the best possible trade-off between win-rate against the base model vs KL distance from the base model. Then, best-of-$n$ is a Pareto-optimal win-rate vs KL solution.The second problem we consider is how to fine-tune a model to mimic the best-of-$n$ sampling distribution, to avoid drawing $n$ samples for each inference.

However, the dominant model architecture in computer vision, the vision transformer (ViT), cannot effectively leverage larger images without finetuning — ViTs poorly extrapolate to more patches at test time, although transformers offer sequence length flexibility. We attribute this shortcoming to the current patch position encoding methods, which create a distribution shift when extrapolating.We propose a drop-in replacement for the position encoding of plain ViTs that restricts attention heads to fixed fields of view, pointed in different directions, using 2D attention masks. Our novel method, called LookHere, provides translation-equivariance, ensures attention head diversity, and limits the distribution shift that attention heads face when extrapolating. We demonstrate that LookHere improves performance on classification (avg. 1.6%), against adversarial attack (avg. 5.4%), and decreases calibration error (avg. 1.5%) — on ImageNet without extrapolation. With extrapolation, LookHere outperforms the current SoTA position encoding method, 2D-RoPE, by 21.7% on ImageNet when trained at $224^2$ px and tested at $1024^2$ px.

Using a clothed human mesh as a central coarse geometric representation, the proposed mesh attention leverages rasterization and projection to establish direct cross-view coordinate correspondences. This approach significantly reduces the complexity of multiview attention while maintaining cross-view consistency. Building on this foundation, we devise a mesh attention block and combine it with keypoint conditioning to create our human-specific multiview diffusion model, MEAT.

Object customization, using reference images and textual descriptions, is key to addressing this issue. Current object customization methods are either object-specific, requiring extensive fine-tuning, or object-agnostic, offering zero-shot customization but limited to specialized domains. The primary issue of promoting zero-shot object customization from specific domains to the general domain is to establish a large-scale general ID dataset for model pre-training, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive. In this paper, we propose a novel pipeline to construct a large dataset of general objects and build the Multi-Category ID-Consistent (MC-IDC) dataset, featuring 315k text-image samples across 10k categories. With the help of MC-IDC, we introduce Customizing Anything (CustAny), a zero-shot framework that maintains ID fidelity and supports flexible text editing for general objects. CustAny features three key components: a general ID extraction module, a dual-level ID injection module, and an ID-aware decoupling module, allowing it to customize any object from a single reference image and text prompt. Experiments demonstrate that CustAny outperforms existing methods in both general object customization and specialized domains like human customization and virtual try-on. Our contributions include a large-scale dataset, the CustAny framework and novel ID processing to advance this field. Code and dataset will be released soon inthis https URL.",2025-06-01,1,CVPR

It can guide the direction of artificial intelligence (AI) research toward social decision-making in multi-agent systems, which includes uncertainty from character heterogeneity. In this paper, we introduceepisodic future thinking (EFT) mechanismfor a reinforcement learning (RL) agent, inspired by the cognitive processes observed in animals. To enable future thinking functionality, we first develop amulti-character policythat captures diverse characters with an ensemble of heterogeneous policies. Thecharacterof an agent is defined as a different weight combination on reward components, representing distinct behavioral preferences. The future thinking agent collects observation-action trajectories of the target agents and leverages the pre-trained multi-character policy to infer their characters. Once the character is inferred, the agent predicts the upcoming actions of target agents and simulates the potential future scenario. This capability allows the agent to adaptively select the optimal action, considering the predicted future scenario in multi-agent scenarios. To evaluate the proposed mechanism, we consider the multi-agent autonomous driving scenario in which autonomous vehicles with different driving traits are on the road. Simulation results demonstrate that the EFT mechanism with accurate character inference leads to a higher reward than existing multi-agent solutions. We also confirm that the effect of reward improvement remains valid across societies with different levels of character diversity.",2024-12-16,3,NeurIPS

				764-772","Enhancing the intelligence of smart systems, such as smart homes, smart vehicles, and smart grids, critically depends on developing sophisticated planning capabilities that can anticipate the next desired function based on historical interactions. While existing methods view user behaviors as sequential data and apply models like RNNs and Transformers to predict future actions, they often fail to incorporate domain knowledge and capture personalized user preferences. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that incorporates LLM-enhanced logs and personalized prompts. Our approach first constructs a graph that captures individual behavior preferences derived from their interaction histories. This graph effectively transforms into a soft continuous prompt that precedes the sequence of user behaviors. Then our approach leverages the vast general knowledge and robust reasoning capabilities of a pretrained LLM to enrich the oversimplified and incomplete log records. By enhancing these logs semantically, our approach better understands the user's actions and intentions, especially for those rare events in the dataset. We evaluate the method across four real-world datasets from both smart vehicle and smart home settings. The findings validate the effectiveness of our LLM-enhanced description and personalized prompt, shedding light on potential ways to advance the intelligence of smart space.",2025-04-11,1,AAAI

One main challenge in state-of-the-art retrieval methods lies in the modality gap, which stems from the substantial disparities between text and video and can persist in the joint space. In this work, we leverage the potential of Diffusion models to address the text-video modality gap by progressively aligning text and video embeddings in a unified space. However, we identify two key limitations of existing Diffusion models in retrieval tasks: The L2 loss does not fit the ranking problem inherent in text-video retrieval, and the generation quality heavily depends on the varied initial point drawn from the isotropic Gaussian, causing inaccurate retrieval. To this end, we introduce a new Diffusion-Inspired Truncated Sampler (DITS) that jointly performs progressive alignment and modality gap modeling in the joint embedding space. The key innovation of DITS is to leverage the inherent proximity of text and video embeddings, defining a truncated diffusion flow from the fixed text embedding to the video embedding, enhancing controllability compared to adopting the isotropic Gaussian. Moreover, DITS adopts the contrastive loss to jointly consider the relevant and irrelevant pairs, not only facilitating alignment but also yielding a discriminatively structured embedding. Experiments on five benchmark datasets suggest the state-of-the-art performance of DITS. We empirically find that DITS can also improve the structure of the CLIP embedding space.

Not only does our research complement existing studies that describe neural networks as kernel machines or infinite-sized Gaussian processes, it also elucidates a more direct approximation that DNNs make to exact inference in PGMs. Potential benefits include improved pedagogy and interpretation of DNNs, and algorithms that can merge the strengths of PGMs and DNNs.",2024-12-16,1,NeurIPS

Consequently, many design decisions in this domain are made without proper justification or analysis. The high computational cost of training and evaluating such models, coupled with limited open research, hinders the development of video-LMMs. To address this, we present a comprehensive study that helps uncover what effectively drives video understanding in LMMs.We begin by critically examining the primary contributors to the high computational requirements associated with video-LMM research and discover Scaling Consistency, wherein design and training decisions made on smaller models and datasets (up to a critical size) effectively transfer to larger models. Leveraging these insights, we explored many video-specific aspects of video-LMMs, including video sampling, architectures, data composition, training schedules, and more. For example, we demonstrated that fps sampling during training is vastly preferable to uniform frame sampling and which vision encoders are the best for video representation.Guided by these findings, we introduce Apollo, a state-of-the-art family of LMMs that achieve superior performance across different model sizes. Our models can perceive hour-long videos efficiently, with Apollo-3B outperforming most existing $7$B models with an impressive 55.1 on LongVideoBench.

Existing work has primarily focused on either i.i.d. data or linear update rules. We take a new perspective and carefully examine the simultaneous presence of Markovian dependency of data and nonlinear update rules, delineating how the interplay between these two structures leads to complications that are not captured by prior techniques. By leveraging the smoothness and recurrence properties of the SA updates, we develop a fine-grained analysis of the correlation between the SA iterates $\theta_k$ and Markovian data $x_k$. This enables us to overcome the obstacles in existing analysis and establish for the first time the weak convergence of the joint process $(x_k, \theta_k)$. Furthermore, we present a precise characterization of the asymptotic bias of the SA iterates, given by $\mathbb{E}[\theta_\infty]-\theta^\ast=\alpha(b_\textup{m}+b_\textup{n}+b_\textup{c})+\mathcal{O}(\alpha^{3/2})$. Here, $b_\textup{m}$ is associated with the Markovian noise, $b_\textup{n}$ is tied to the nonlinearity of the SA operator, and notably, $b_\textup{c}$ represents a multiplicative interaction between the Markovian noise and the nonlinearity of the operator, which is absent in previous works.

This paper studies how LLMs are seemingly able to reflect more liberal versus more conservative viewpoints among other political perspectives in American politics. We show that LLMs possess linear representations of political perspectives within activation space, wherein more similar perspectives are represented closer together. To do so, we probe the attention heads across the layers of three open transformer-based LLMs (Llama-2-7b-chat, Mistral-7b-instruct, Vicuna-7b). We first prompt models to generate text from the perspectives of different U.S. lawmakers. We then identify sets of attention heads whose activations linearly predict those lawmakers' DW-NOMINATE scores, a widely-used and validated measure of political ideology. We find that highly predictive heads are primarily located in the middle layers, often speculated to encode high-level concepts and tasks. Using probes only trained to predict lawmakers' ideology, we then show that the same probes can predict measures of news outlets' slant from the activations of models prompted to simulate text from those news outlets. These linear probes allow us to visualize, interpret, and monitor ideological stances implicitly adopted by an LLM as it generates open-ended responses. Finally, we demonstrate that by applying linear interventions to these attention heads, we can steer the model outputs toward a more liberal or conservative stance. Overall, our research suggests that LLMs possess a high-level linear representation of American political ideology and that by leveraging recent advances in mechanistic interpretability, we can identify, monitor, and steer the subjective perspective underlying generated text.",2024-10-04,15,ICLR

We study the influence of weight decay as well as $L2$-regularization when training neural network models in which parameter matrices interact multiplicatively. This combination is of particular interest as this parametrization is common in attention layers, the workhorse of transformers. Here, key-query, as well as value-projection parameter matrices, are multiplied directly with each other: $W_K^TW_Q$ and $PW_V$. We extend previous results and show on one hand that any local minimum of a $L2$-regularized loss of the form $L(AB^\top) + \lambda (\|A\|^2 + \|B\|^2)$ coincides with a minimum of the nuclear norm-regularized loss $L(AB^\top) + \lambda\|AB^\top\|_*$, and on the other hand that the 2 losses become identical exponentially quickly during training. We thus complement existing works linking $L2$-regularization with low-rank regularization, and in particular, explain why such regularization on the matrix product affects early stages of training.Based on these theoretical insights, we verify empirically that the key-query and value-projection matrix products $W_K^TW_Q, PW_V$ within attention layers, when optimized with weight decay, as usually done in vision tasks and language modelling, indeed induce a significant reduction in the rank of $W_K^TW_Q$ and $PW_V$, even in fully online training.We find that, in accordance with existing work, inducing low rank in attention matrix products can damage language model performance, and observe advantages when decoupling weight decay in attention layers from the rest of the parameters.",2024-12-16,16,NeurIPS

In this paper, we introduce EgoPressure, a novel egocentric dataset that captures detailed touch contact and pressure interactions. EgoPressure provides high-resolution pressure intensity annotations for each contact point and includes accurate hand pose meshes obtained through our proposed multi-view, sequence-based optimization method processing data from an 8-camera capture rig. Our dataset comprises 5 hours of recorded interactions from 21 participants captured simultaneously by one head-mounted and seven stationary Kinect cameras, which acquire RGB images and depth maps at 30 Hz. To support future research and benchmarking, we present several baseline models for estimating applied pressure on external surfaces from RGB images, with and without hand pose information.

Nevertheless, despite existing pessimistic analyses, empirical evidence suggests that sketch-DL is competitive with its uncompressed counterpart, thus motivating a sharper analysis.

In this formulation, a path that traverses a high density (that is, probable) region of image latent space is shorter than the equivalent path through a low density region. We present algorithms for solving the associated initial and boundary value problems and show how to compute the probability density along the path and the geodesic distance between two points.

To facilitate the study, we introduce ZhuangRules, a modularized dataset of grammar rules and their corresponding test sentences. Our analysis reveals that rule retrieval constitutes a primary bottleneck in grammar-based translation. Moreover, although LLMs can apply simple rules for translation when explicitly provided, they encounter difficulties in handling more complex rules. To address these challenges, we propose representing grammar rules as code functions, considering their similarities in structure and the benefit of code in facilitating LLM reasoning.

In this paper, we investigate this issue in the context of the increasingly popular linearized Laplace approximation. Specifically, it has been observed that linearized predictives alleviate the common underfitting problems of the Laplace approximation.

However, transformer-based networks are notorious for their quadratic computation complexity, seriously undermining their efficacy and deployment in semantic occupancy prediction. Inspired by the global modeling and linear computation complexity of the Mamba architecture, we present the first Mamba-based network for semantic occupancy prediction, termed OccMamba. Specifically, we first design the hierarchical Mamba module and local context processor to better aggregate global and local contextual information, respectively.

While methods like self-supervised learning and graph prompt learning have been extensively explored, they often rely on fine-tuning with task-specific labels, limiting their effectiveness in zero-shot scenarios. Inspired by the zero-shot capabilities of instruction-fine-tuned large language models (LLMs), we introduce a novel framework named Token Embedding-Aligned Graph Language Model (TEA-GLM) that leverages LLMs as cross-dataset and cross-task zero-shot learners for graph machine learning.

We then train a linear projector that transforms the GNN's representations into a fixed number of graph token embeddings without tuning the LLM. A unified instruction is designed for various graph tasks at different levels, such as node classification (node-level) and link prediction (edge-level).

We propose VISCO, the first benchmark to extensively analyze the fine-grained critique and correction capabilities of LVLMs. Compared to existing work that uses a single scalar value to critique the entire reasoning [4], VISCO features dense and fine-grained critique, requiring LVLMs to evaluate the correctness of each step in the chain-of-thought and provide natural language explanations to support their judgments. Extensive evaluation of 24 LVLMs demonstrates that human-written critiques significantly enhance the performance after correction, showcasing the potential of the self-improvement strategy. However, the model-generated critiques are less helpful and sometimes detrimental to the performance, suggesting that critique is the crucial bottleneck. We identified three common patterns in critique failures: failure to critique visual perception, reluctance to ""say no"", and exaggerated assumption of error propagation.

However, this places a significant burden on token representations to encode all language-specific information, which may hinder language neutrality. To address this limitation, we propose Language-Script Aware Multilingual Pretraining (LangSAMP), a method that incorporates both language and script embeddings to enhance representation learning. Specifically, we integrate these embeddings into the output of the Transformer blocks before passing the final representations to the language modeling head for prediction. We apply LangSAMP to the continual pretraining of XLM-R on a highly multilingual corpus covering more than 500 languages. The resulting model consistently outperforms the baseline in zero-shot crosslingual transfer across diverse downstream tasks. Extensive analysis reveals that language and script embeddings capture language- and script-specific nuances, which benefits more language-neutral representations, proven by improved pairwise cosine similarity. In our case study, we also show that language and script embeddings can be used to select better source languages for crosslingual transfer.

We evaluate models from five leading companies (OpenAI, Anthropic, Meta, Mistral, Google) and find that some LLMs are explicitly designed to favor their developers' products and exhibit untruthful communication, among other manipulative behaviors.

One promising direction is to develop a tokenizer that can encode long video clips, as it would enable the tokenizer to leverage the temporal coherence of videos better for tokenization. However, training existing tokenizers on long videos often incurs a huge training cost as they are trained to reconstruct all the frames at once. In this paper, we introduce CoordTok, a video tokenizer that learns a mapping from coordinate-based representations to the corresponding patches of input videos, inspired by recent advances in 3D generative models. In particular, CoordTok encodes a video into factorized triplane representations and reconstructs patches that correspond to randomly sampled $(x,y,t)$ coordinates. This allows for training large tokenizer models directly on long videos without requiring excessive training resources. Our experiments show that CoordTok can drastically reduce the number of tokens for encoding long video clips. For instance, CoordTok can encode a 128-frame video with 128$\times$128 resolution into 1280 tokens, while baselines need 6144 or 8192 tokens to achieve similar reconstruction quality. We further show that this efficient video tokenization enables memory-efficient training of a diffusion transformer that can generate 128 frames at once.",2025-06-01,2,CVPR

Conventional wisdom holds its superiority over continual SFT during this preference alignment stage. In this paper, we observe that the inherent value of multimodal RLHF lies in its negative supervision, the logit of the rejected responses. We thus propose a novel negative supervised finetuning (nSFT) approach that fully excavates these information resided. Our nSFT disentangles this negative supervision in RLHF paradigm, and continually aligns VLMs with a simple SFT loss. This is more memory efficient than multimodal RLHF where 2 (e.g., DPO) or 4 (e.g., PPO) large VLMs are strictly required. The effectiveness of nSFT is rigorously proved by comparing it with various multimodal RLHF approaches, across different dataset sources, base VLMs and evaluation metrics. Besides, fruitful of ablations are provided to support our hypothesis. We hope this paper will stimulate further research to properly align large vision language models.",2025-06-01,2,CVPR

However, existing DNNs are mostly designed to analyze neural responses to static images, relying on feedforward structures and lacking physiological neuronal mechanisms. There is limited insight into how the visual cortex represents natural movie stimuli that contain context-rich information. To address these problems, this work proposes the long-range feedback spiking network (LoRaFB-SNet), which mimics top-down connections between cortical regions and incorporates spike information processing mechanisms inherent to biological neurons. Taking into account the temporal dependence of representations under movie stimuli, we present Time-Series Representational Similarity Analysis (TSRSA) to measure the similarity between model representations and visual cortical representations of mice. LoRaFB-SNet exhibits the highest level of representational similarity, outperforming other well-known and leading alternatives across various experimental paradigms, especially when representing long movie stimuli. We further conduct experiments to quantify how temporal structures (dynamic information) and static textures (static information) of the movie stimuli influence representational similarity, suggesting that our model benefits from long-range feedback to encode context-dependent representations just like the brain. Altogether, LoRaFB-SNet is highly competent in capturing both dynamic and static representations of the mouse visual cortex and contributes to the understanding of movie processing mechanisms of the visual system.

Recently, interest has grown in systems for cancer pain treatment effectiveness assessment (TEA) and medication recommendation (MR) to optimize pharmacological care. These systems aim to improve treatment effectiveness by recommending personalized medication plans based on comprehensive patient information.

However, existing metrics have a context-blindness problem, indiscriminately applying the same evaluation criteria on completely different pairs of source image and target text, biasing towards either modification or preservation. Directional CLIP similarity, the only metric that considers both source image and target text, is also biased towards modification aspects and attends to irrelevant editing regions of the image. We propose AugCLIP, a context-aware metric that adaptively coordinates preservation and modification aspects, depending on the specific context of a given source image and target text. This is done by deriving the CLIP representation of an ideally edited image, that preserves the source image with necessary modifications to align with target text. More specifically, using a multi-modal large language model, AugCLIP augments the textual descriptions of the source and target, then calculates a modification vector through a hyperplane that separates source and target attributes in CLIP space.

Inspired by the phenomenon of *neural collapse* (NC) in image classification, we empirically demonstrate the prevalent emergence of a similar *law of clustering* in the visual representation space. Specifically, 

- In discrete image-based control (e.g., Lunar Lander), the visual representations cluster according to the natural discrete action labels;

- In continuous image-based control (e.g., Planar Pushing and Block Stacking), the clustering emerges according to ``control-oriented'' classes that are based on (a) the relative pose between the object and the target in the input or (b) the relative pose of the object induced by expert actions in the output. Each of the classes corresponds to one relative pose orthant (REPO).

Beyond empirical observation, we show such a law of clustering can be leveraged as an algorithmic tool to improve test-time performance when training a policy with limited expert demonstrations. Particularly, we pretrain the vision encoder using NC as a regularization to encourage control-oriented clustering of the visual features. Surprisingly, such an NC-pretrained vision encoder, when finetuned end-to-end with the action decoder, boosts the test-time performance by 10% to 35%.

To address this problem while keeping the simplicity of a regular grid structure, our approach builds upon the standard grid-based paradigm by constructing multiple elementary metric grids as high-order terms to approximate complex nonlinearities, following the Taylor expansion principle. Furthermore, we enhance model compactness with hash encoding based on different sparsities of the grids to prevent detrimental hash collisions, and a high-order extrapolation decoder to reduce explicit grid storage requirements. experimental results on both 2D and 3D reconstructions demonstrate the superior fitting and rendering accuracy of the proposed method across diverse signal types, validating its robustness and generalizability.

Given that it is infeasible to directly train a model on 'whole' images from domains with potential gigapixel sizes, diffusion-based generative methods have focused on synthesizing small, fixed-size patches extracted from these images. However, generating small patches has limited applicability since patch-based models fail to capture the global structures and wider context of large images, which can be crucial for synthesizing (semantically) accurate samples. To overcome this limitation, we present ZoomLDM, a diffusion model tailored for generating images across multiple scales. Central to our approach is a novel magnification-aware conditioning mechanism that utilizes self-supervised learning (SSL) embeddings and allows the diffusion model to synthesize images at different 'zoom' levels, i.e., fixed-size patches extracted from large images at varying scales.

Second, densely distributed random noise reduces the accuracy of estimating the global geometric structure of the scene.

However, we dig into current evaluation works and identify two primary issues: 1) Visual content is unnecessary for many samples.

For instance, GeminiPro achieves 42.7% on the MMMU benchmark without any visual input, and outperforms the random choice baseline across six benchmarks near 24% on average. 2) Unintentional data leakage exists in LLM and LVLM training. LLM and LVLM could still answer some visual-necessary questions without visual content, indicating the memorizing of these samples within large-scale training data.

To address it, we propose a cross-scale diffusion that models the joint probability distribution of global full-body shape and local facial characteristics, enabling detailed and identity-preserved novel-view generation without any geometric distortion. Moreover, to enhance cross-view body shape consistency of varied human poses, we condition the generative model on parametric models like SMPL-X, which provide body priors and prevent unnatural views inconsistent with human anatomy. Leveraging the generated multi-view normal and color images, we present SMPLX-initialized explicit human carving to recover realistic textured human meshes efficiently. Extensive experimental results and quantitative evaluations on CAPE and THuman2.1 datasets demonstrate PSHumans superiority in geometry details, texture fidelity, and generalization capability.",2025-06-01,9,CVPR

To this end, we present DnLUT, an ultra-efficient lookup table-based framework that achieves high-quality color image denoising with minimal resource consumption. Our key innovation lies in two complementary components: a Pairwise Channel Mixer (PCM) that effectively captures inter-channel correlations and spatial dependencies in parallel, and a novel L-shaped convolution design that maximizes receptive field coverage while minimizing storage overhead. By converting these components into optimized lookup tables post-training, DnLUT achieves remarkable efficiency - requiring only 500KB storage and 0.1% energy consumption compared to its CNN contestant DnCNN, while delivering 20X faster inference.

This has been widely demonstrated and applied in machine learning to train models that are capable of generalizing to novel settings. However, there has been limited work exploiting the shared structure in neural activity during similar tasks for learning latent dynamics from neural recordings.
Existing approaches are designed to infer dynamics from a single dataset and cannot be readily adapted to account for statistical heterogeneities across recordings. In this work, we hypothesize that similar tasks admit a corresponding family of

We examine different LVLMs and pinpoint that one root cause of object hallucinations lies with deficient attention on discriminative image features. Specifically, LVLMs often predominantly attend to prompt-irrelevant global features instead of prompt-relevant local features, undermining their visual grounding capacity and leading to object hallucinations. We propose Assembly of Global and Local Attention (AGLA), a training-free and plug-and-play approach that mitigates hallucinations by assembling global features for response generation and local features for visual discrimination simultaneously. Specifically, we introduce an image-prompt matching scheme that captures prompt-relevant local features from images, leading to an augmented view of the input image where prompt-relevant content is highlighted while irrelevant distractions are suppressed. Hallucinations can thus be mitigated with a calibrated logit distribution that is from generative global features of the original image and discriminative local features of the augmented image. Extensive experiments show the superiority of AGLA in LVLM hallucination mitigation, demonstrating its wide applicability across both discriminative and generative tasks.

We identify two primary challenges under the setting: inaccurate model estimation due to limited data and performance degradation caused by the model mismatch between the dataset-collecting environment and the target deployment one. To tackle these issues, we propose a unified principle of pessimism using distributionally robust Markov decision processes. We carefully construct a robust MDP with a single uncertainty set to tackle both data sparsity and model mismatch, and demonstrate that the optimal robust policy enjoys a near-optimal sub-optimality gap under the target environment across three widely used uncertainty models: total variation, $\chi^2$ divergence, and KL divergence.

Prior studies focused on modeling the catastrophic forgetting and background shift challenges in continual learning. However, fairness, another major challenge that causes unfair predictions leading to low performance among major and minor classes, still needs to be well addressed. In addition, prior methods have yet to model the unknown classes well, thus resulting in producing non-discriminative features among unknown classes. This work presents a novel Fairness Learning via Contrastive Attention Approach to continual learning in semantic scene understanding. In particular, we first introduce a new Fairness Contrastive Clustering loss to address the problems of catastrophic forgetting and fairness. Then, we propose an attention-based visual grammar approach to effectively model the background shift problem and unknown classes, producing better feature representations for different unknown classes.

However, advancements in text-to-video (T2V) and image-to-video (I2V) generative models now allow fully AI-generated synthetic content and seamless background alterations, challenging face-centric detection methods and demanding more versatile approaches.To address this, we introduce the \underline{U}niversal \underline{N}etwork for \underline{I}dentifying \underline{T}ampered and synth\underline{E}tic videos (\texttt{UNITE}) model, which, unlike traditional detectors, captures full-frame manipulations. \texttt{UNITE} extends detection capabilities to scenarios without faces, non-human subjects, and complex background modifications. It leverages a transformer-based architecture that processes domain-agnostic features extracted from videos via the SigLIP-So400M foundation model. Given limited datasets encompassing both facial/background alterations and T2V/I2V content, we integrate task-irrelevant data alongside standard DeepFake datasets in training. We further mitigate the model's tendency to over-focus on faces by incorporating an attention-diversity (AD) loss, which promotes diverse spatial attention across video frames. Combining AD loss with cross-entropy improves detection performance across varied contexts.

To ensure efficiency, recent methods leverage 2D CNNs operating in texture space to learn rendering primitives. However, they either jointly learn geometry and appearance, or completely ignore sparse image information for geometry estimation, significantly harming visual quality and robustness to unseen body poses. To address these issues, we present Double Unprojected Textures, which at the core disentangles coarse geometric deformation estimation from appearance synthesis, enabling robust and photorealistic 4K rendering in real-time. Specifically, we first introduce a novel image-conditioned template deformation network, which estimates the coarse deformation of the human template from a first unprojected texture. This updated geometry is then used to apply a second and more accurate texture unprojection. The resulting texture map has fewer artifacts and better alignment with input views, which benefits our learning of finer-level geometry and appearance represented by Gaussian splats.

Compared to frame-based camera, a novel type of bio-inspired visual sensor, i.e. event camera, has demonstrated advantages in high temporal resolution, high dynamic range, low power consumption and low latency. Due to its unique asynchronous and irregular data capturing process, limited work has been proposed to apply neural representation or 3D Gaussian splatting for an event camera. In this work, we present IncEventGS, an incremental 3D Gaussian Splatting reconstruction algorithm with a single event camera. To recover the 3D scene representation incrementally, we exploit the tracking and mapping paradigm of conventional SLAM pipelines for IncEventGS. Given the incoming event stream, the tracker firstly estimates an initial camera motion based on prior reconstructed 3D-GS scene representation. The mapper then jointly refines both the 3D scene representation and camera motion based on the previously estimated motion trajectory from the tracker. The experimental results demonstrate that IncEventGS delivers superior performance compared to prior NeRF-based methods and other related baselines, even we do not have the ground-truth camera poses.

To mitigate this issue, we introduce an efficient method that edits the model weights based on an unsafe subspace, which we call HalluSpace in this paper. With truthful and hallucinated text prompts accompanying the visual content as inputs, the HalluSpace can be identified by extracting the hallucinated embedding features and removing the truthful representations in LVLMs. By orthogonalizing the model weights, input features will be projected into the Null space of the HalluSpace to reduce OH, based on which we name our method Nullu. We reveal that HalluSpaces generally contain prior information in the large language models (LLMs) applied to build LVLMs, which have been shown as essential causes of OH in previous studies. Therefore, null space projection suppresses the LLMs' priors to filter out the hallucinated features, resulting in contextually accurate outputs. Experiments show that our method can effectively mitigate OH across different LVLM families without extra inference costs and also show strong performance in general LVLM benchmarks.

We introduce MIDGArD (Modular Interpretable Diffusion over Graphs for Articulated Designs), a novel diffusion-based framework for articulated 3D asset generation. MIDGArD improves over foundational work in the field by enhancing quality, consistency, and controllability in the generation process. This is achieved through MIDGArD's modular approach that separates the problem into two primary components: structure generation and shape generation. The structure generation module of MIDGArD aims at producing coherent articulation features from noisy or incomplete inputs. It acts on the object's structural and kinematic attributes, represented as features of a graph that are being progressively denoised to issue coherent and interpretable articulation solutions. This denoised graph then serves as an advanced conditioning mechanism for the shape generation module, a 3D generative model that populates each link of the articulated structure with consistent 3D meshes. Experiments show the superiority of MIDGArD on the quality, consistency, and interpretability of the generated assets.

Probabilistic Principal Component Analysis (PPCA) is a prominent dimensionality reduction method that provides a probabilistic approach unlike the deterministic approach of PCA and serves as a connection between PCA and Factor Analysis (FA). Despite their power, PPCA and its extensions are mainly based on linear models and can only describe the data in a Euclidean coordinate system around the mean of data. However, in many neuroscience applications, data may be distributed around a nonlinear geometry (i.e., manifold) rather than lying in the Euclidean space around the mean. We develop Probabilistic Geometric Principal Component Analysis (PGPCA) for such datasets as a new dimensionality reduction algorithm that can explicitly incorporate knowledge about a given nonlinear manifold that is first fitted from these data. Further, we show how in addition to the Euclidean coordinate system, a geometric coordinate system can be derived for the manifold to capture the deviations of data from the manifold and noise. We also derive a data-driven EM algorithm for learning the PGPCA model parameters. As such, PGPCA generalizes PPCA to better describe data distributions by incorporating a nonlinear manifold geometry. In simulations and brain data analyses, we show that PGPCA can effectively model the data distribution around various given manifolds and outperforms PPCA for such data. Moreover, PGPCA provides the capability to test whether the new geometric coordinate system better describes the data than the Euclidean one. Finally, PGPCA can perform dimensionality reduction and learn the data distribution both around and on the manifold. These capabilities make PGPCA valuable for enhancing the efficacy of dimensionality reduction for analysis of high-dimensional data that exhibit noise and are distributed around a nonlinear manifold, especially for neural data.",2024-10-04,1,ICLR

We address these challenges by developing an algorithm that handles delayed feedback, balancing exploration and exploitation using confidence bounds and optimism. We first consider a censored setting where a threshold for considering feedback is imposed by business requirements. Our algorithm demonstrates a $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{NT})$ regret, with a matching lower bound up to a logarithmic term.

Although storing images of old classes and directly incorporating them into the training of new models has proven effective in mitigating catastrophic forgetting in classification tasks, this strategy presents notable limitations in CSS. Specifically, the stored and new images with partial category annotations leads to confusion between unannotated categories and the background, complicating model fitting. To tackle this issue, this paper proposes a novel Enhanced Instance Replay (EIR) method, which not only preserves knowledge of old classes while simultaneously eliminating background confusion by instance storage of old classes, but also mitigates background shifts in the new images by integrating stored instances with new images. By effectively resolving background shifts in both stored and new images, EIR alleviates catastrophic forgetting in the CSS task, thereby enhancing the model's capacity for CSS.

For a broad class of potential functions, we show that mirror flow exhibits lazy training and has the same implicit bias as ordinary gradient flow when the network width tends to infinity. For univariate ReLU networks, we characterize this bias through a variational problem in function space. Our analysis includes prior results for ordinary gradient flow as a special case and lifts limitations which required either an intractable adjustment of the training data or networks with skip connections. We further introduce \emph{scaled potentials} and show that for these, mirror flow still exhibits lazy training but is not in the kernel regime. For univariate networks with absolute value activations, we show that mirror flow with scaled potentials induces a rich class of biases, which generally cannot be captured by an RKHS norm. A takeaway is that whereas the parameter initialization determines how strongly the curvature of the learned function is penalized at different locations of the input space, the scaled potential determines how the different magnitudes of the curvature are penalized.",2024-10-04,1,ICLR

While significant strides have been made in understanding learning in artificial neural networks, applying this knowledge to biological networks remains challenging.  For instance, while backpropagation is known to perform accurate credit assignment of error in artificial neural networks, how a similarly powerful process can be realized within the constraints of biological circuits remains largely unclear.  One of the major challenges is that the brain's extensive recurrent connectivity requires the propagation of error through both space and time, a problem that is notoriously difficult to solve in vanilla recurrent neural networks.  Moreover, the extensive feedback connections in the brain are known to influence forward network activity, but the interaction between feedback-driven activity changes and local, synaptic plasticity-based learning is not fully understood.  Building on our previous work modelling motor learning, this work investigates the mechanistic properties of pre-trained networks with feedback control on a standard motor task.  We show that feedback control of the ongoing recurrent network dynamics approximates the optimal first-order gradient with respect to the network activities, allowing for rapid, ongoing movement correction.  Moreover, we show that trial-by-trial adaptation to a persistent perturbation using a local, biologically plausible learning rule that integrates recent activity and error feedback is both more accurate and more efficient with feedback control during learning, due to the decoupling of the recurrent network dynamics and the injection of an adaptive, second-order gradient into the network dynamics.

However, identifying the conditions that promote compositionality remains an open issue, with recent efforts concentrating mainly on linearized networks. We conduct a theoretical study that attempts to demystify compositionality in standard non-linear networks through the second-order Taylor approximation of the loss function. The proposed formulation highlights the importance of staying within the pre-training basin to achieve composable modules. Moreover, it provides the basis for two dual incremental training algorithms: the one from the perspective of multiple models trained individually, while the other aims to optimize the composed model as a whole. We probe their application in incremental classification tasks and highlight some valuable skills. In fact, the pool of incrementally learned modules not only supports the creation of an effective multi-task model but also enables unlearning and specialization in certain tasks.

To address this challenge, we propose D-AdaST, a Distributed Adaptive minimax method with Stepsize Tracking. The key strategy is to employ an adaptive stepsize tracking protocol involving the transmission of two extra (scalar) variables. This protocol ensures the consistency among stepsizes of nodes, eliminating the steady-state error due to the lack of coordination of stepsizes among nodes that commonly exists in vanilla distributed adaptive methods, and thus guarantees exact convergence. For nonconvex-strongly-concave distributed minimax problems, we characterize the specific transient times that ensure time-scale separation of stepsizes and quasi-independence of networks, leading to a near-optimal convergence rate of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}} \left( \epsilon ^{-\left( 4+\delta \right)} \right)$ for any small $\delta > 0$, matching that of the centralized counterpart. To our best knowledge, D-AdaST is the *first* distributed adaptive method achieving near-optimal convergence without knowing any problem-dependent parameters for nonconvex minimax problems.

However, existing watermark methods often struggle with a fundamental dilemma: improving watermark effectiveness (the detectability of the watermark) often comes at the cost of reduced text quality. This trade-off limits their practical application. To address this challenge, we first formalize the problem within a multi-objective trade-off analysis framework. Within this framework, we identify a key factor that influences the dilemma. Unlike existing methods, where watermark strength is typically treated as a fixed hyperparameter, our theoretical insights lead to the development of MorphMark—a method that adaptively adjusts the watermark strength in response to changes in the identified factor, thereby achieving an effective resolution of the dilemma. In addition, MorphMark also prioritizes flexibility since it is an model-agnostic and model-free watermark method, thereby offering a practical solution for real-world deployment, particularly in light of the rapid evolution of AI models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MorphMark achieves a superior resolution of the effectiveness-quality dilemma, while also offering greater flexibility and time and space efficiency.",2025-07-01,4,ACL

However, many problems remain to be investigated for this direction. For the task of Relation Extraction (RE), we find that samples generated by directly prompting LLMs may easily have high structural similarities with each other. They tend to use a limited variety of phrasing while expressing the relation between a pair of entities. Therefore, in this paper, we study how to effectively improve the diversity of the training samples generated with LLMs for RE, while also maintaining their correctness. We first try to make the LLMs produce dissimilar samples by directly giving instructions in In-Context Learning (ICL) prompts. Then, we propose an approach to fine-tune LLMs for diversity training sample generation through Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Our experiments on commonly used RE datasets show that both attempts can improve the quality of the generated training data. We also find that comparing with directly performing RE with an LLM, training a non-LLM RE model with its generated samples may lead to better performance.",2025-07-01,1,ACL

Visual prompt tuning is introduced as a parameter-efficient finetuning (PEFT) method to this trend. Despite its successes, a notable research challenge persists within almost all PEFT approaches: significant performance degradation is observed when there is a substantial disparity between the datasets applied in pretraining and finetuning phases. To address this challenge, we draw inspiration from human visual cognition, and propose the Visual Fourier Prompt Tuning (VFPT) method as a general and effective solution for adapting large-scale transformer-based models. Our approach innovatively incorporates the Fast Fourier Transform into prompt embeddings and harmoniously considers both spatial and frequency domain information. Apart from its inherent simplicity and intuitiveness, VFPT exhibits superior performance across all datasets, offering a general solution to dataset challenges, irrespective of data disparities.

Modern approaches typically rely on large Gaussian kernels to extend motion trajectories as condition without explicitly defining movement region, leading to coarse motion control and failing to disentangle object and camera moving. To alleviate these, we present MotionPro, a precise motion controller that novelly leverages region-wise trajectory and motion mask to regulate fine-grained motion synthesis and identify target motion category (i.e., object or camera moving), respectively. Technically, MotionPro first estimates the flow maps on each training video via a tracking model, and then samples the region-wise trajectories to simulate inference scenario. Instead of extending flow through large Gaussian kernels, our region-wise trajectory approach enables more precise control by directly utilizing trajectories within local regions, thereby effectively characterizing fine-grained movements. A motion mask is simultaneously derived from the predicted flow maps to capture the holistic motion dynamics of the movement regions. To pursue natural motion control, MotionPro further strengthens video denoising by incorporating both region-wise trajectories and motion mask through feature modulation. More remarkably, we meticulously construct a benchmark, i.e., MC-Bench, with 1.1K user-annotated image-trajectory pairs, for the evaluation of both fine-grained and object-level I2V motion control.

It is, for example, the root of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction, data visualization, and noise filtering, and of Density Functional Theory (DFT), arguably the most popular method to calculate the electronic structure of materials. Given Hermitian $H,S\in\mathbb{C}^{n\times n}$, where $S$ is positive-definite,  let $\Pi_k$ be the true spectral projector on the invariant subspace that is associated with the $k$ smallest (or largest) eigenvalues of the GEP $HC=SC\Lambda$, for some $k\in[n]$.

Our method processes full images to maintain scene context and accepts multiple input modalities: spatial prompts like bounding boxes and masks, and semantic prompts like language descriptions or interaction labels. PromptHMR demonstrates robust performance across challenging scenarios: estimating people from bounding boxes as small as faces in crowded scenes, improving body shape estimation through language descriptions, modeling person-person interactions, and producing temporally coherent motions in videos.

SMoE has the potential to exponentially increase in parameter count while maintaining the efficiency of the model by only activating a small subset of these parameters for a given sample. However, it has been observed that SMoE suffers from unstable training and has difficulty adapting to new distributions, leading to the model's lack of robustness to data contamination. To overcome these limitations, we first establish a connection between the dynamics of the expert representations in SMoEs and gradient descent on a multi-objective optimization problem. Leveraging our framework, we then integrate momentum into SMoE and propose a new family of SMoEs, named MomentumSMoE. We theoretically prove and numerically validate that MomentumSMoE is more stable and robust than SMoE. In particular, we verify the advantages of MomentumSMoE over SMoE on a variety of practical tasks including ImageNet-1K object recognition and WikiText-103 language modeling. We demonstrate the applicability of MomentumSMoE to many types of SMoE models, including those in the Sparse MoE model for vision (V-MoE) and the Generalist Language Model (GLaM).

				667-675","Data-free model stealing involves replicating the functionality of a target model into a substitute model without accessing the target model's structure, parameters, or training data. Instead, the adversary can only access the target model's predictions for generated samples. Once the substitute model closely approximates the behavior of the target model, attackers can exploit its white-box characteristics for subsequent malicious activities, such as adversarial attacks. Existing methods within cooperative game frameworks often produce samples with high confidence for the prediction of the substitute model, which makes it difficult for the substitute model to replicate the behavior of the target model. This paper presents a new data-free model stealing approach called Query Efficient Data Generation (QEDG). We introduce two distinct loss functions to ensure the generation of sufficient samples that closely and uniformly align with the target model's decision boundary across multiple classes. Building on the limitation of current methods, which typically yield only one piece of supervised information per query, we propose the query-free sample augmentation that enables the acquisition of additional supervised information without increasing the number of queries.  Motivated by theoretical analysis, we adopt the consistency rate metric, which more accurately evaluates the similarity between the substitute and target models.

In a nutshell, an MoE model consists of multiple experts in each model layer and routes the training tokens to only a fixed number of experts rather than all.

Due to the frequent and voluminous data exchanges, All-to-All communication has become a notable challenge to training efficiency.

In this paper, we manage to accelerate All-to-All communication in MoE models from the training sample perspective, which is unexplored so far. In particular, we put forward the observation that tokens in the same training sample have certain levels of locality in expert routing. Motivated by this, we develop NetMoE, which takes such locality into account and dynamically rearranges the placement of training samples to minimize All-to-All communication costs. Specifically, we model the All-to-All communication given the sample placement and formulate an integer programming problem to deduce the optimal placement in polynomial time.

This variation leads to feature shift, which is a key issue of this scenario. While previous works have made notable progress, few pay attention to the data itself, i.e., the root of this issue. The primary goal of this paper is to mitigate feature shift from the perspective of data. To this end, we propose a simple yet remarkably effective input-level data augmentation method, namely FedRDN, which randomly injects the statistical information of the local distribution from the entire federation into the client's data.

Existing guardrail models, such as OpenAI Mod and LlamaGuard, treat various safety categories (e.g., self-harm, self-harm/instructions) independently and fail to explicitly capture the intercorrelations among them. This has led to limitations such as ineffectiveness due to inadequate training on long-tail data from correlated safety categories, susceptibility to jailbreaking attacks, and inflexibility regarding new safety categories.
To address these limitations, we propose $R^2$-Guard, a robust reasoning enabled LLM guardrail via knowledge-enhanced logical reasoning. Specifically, $R^2$-Guard comprises two parts: data-driven guardrail models and reasoning components. The data-driven guardrail models provide unsafety probabilities of moderated content on different safety categories.
We then encode safety knowledge among different categories as first-order logical rules and embed them into a probabilistic graphic model (PGM) based reasoning component. The unsafety probabilities of different categories from data-driven guardrail models are sent to the reasoning component for final inference. We employ two types of PGMs: Markov logic networks (MLNs) and probabilistic circuits (PCs), and optimize PCs to achieve precision-efficiency balance via improved graph structure. We also propose different methods to optimize the weights of knowledge. To further perform stress tests for guardrail models, we employ a pairwise construction method to construct a new safety benchmark TwinSafety, which features principled categories and presents new challenges for moderation. We show that $R^2$-Guard is effective even given unrepresentative categories or challenging jailbreaking prompts. We demonstrate the effectiveness of $R^2$-Guard by comparisons with eight strong guardrail models on six standard moderation datasets, and demonstrate the robustness of $R^2$-Guard against four SOTA jailbreaking attacks. $R^2$-Guard significantly surpasses SOTA method LlamaGuard by 12.6% on standard moderation datasets and by 59.9% against jailbreaking attacks.

The synthetic generation of cell topology enables realistic simulations of complex tissue environments, enhances downstream tasks by augmenting training data, aligns more closely with pathologists' domain knowledge, and offers new opportunities for controlling and generalizing the tumor microenvironment. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that integrates topological constraints into a diffusion model to improve the generation of realistic, contextually accurate cell topologies. Our method refines the simulation of cell distributions and interactions, increasing the precision and interpretability of results in downstream tasks such as cell detection and classification. To assess the topological fidelity of generated layouts, we introduce a new metric, Topological Frechet Distance (TopoFD), which overcomes the limitations of traditional metrics like FID in evaluating topological structure.

In this paper, we propose several solvers to estimate both rotational and translational velocities within a unified framework. Our method leverages event manifolds induced by line segments. The problem formulations are based on either an incidence relation for lines or a novel coplanarity relation for normal vectors. We demonstrate the possibility of recovering full-DoF egomotion parameters for both angular and linear velocities without requiring extra sensor measurements or motion priors.

However, we argue that the NOCS map is an inadequate intermediate representation for geometry-guided pose regression method, as its many-to-one correspondence with category-level pose introduces redundant instance-specific information, resulting in suboptimal results. This paper identifies the intra-class variation problem inherent in pose regression based solely on the NOCS map and proposes the Intra-class Variation-Free Consensus (IVFC) map, a novel coordinate representation generated from the category-level consensus model.

Existing methods to modify requests, including those using deep learning, suffer from limited performance and precision, relying on undirected search or making limited usage of the contextual information. In this paper we propose APIRL, a fully automated deep reinforcement learning tool for testing REST APIs. A key novelty of our approach is the use of feedback from a transformer module pre-trained on JSON-structured data, akin to that used in API responses. This allows APIRL to learn the subtleties relating to test outcomes, and generalise to unseen API endpoints.

Existing methods mostly assess the generated panoramas with InceptionNet or CLIP based metrics, which tend to perceive the image quality and is \textbf{not suitable for evaluating the distortion}. In this work, we first propose a distortion-specific CLIP, named Distort-CLIP to accurately evaluate the panorama distortion and discover the \textbf{``visual cheating''} phenomenon in previous works (\ie, tending to improve the visual results by sacrificing distortion accuracy). This phenomenon arises because prior methods employ a single network to learn the distinct panorama distortion and content completion at once, which leads the model to prioritize optimizing the latter. To address the phenomenon, we propose \textbf{PanoDecouple}, a decoupled diffusion model framework, which decouples the panorama generation into distortion guidance and content completion, aiming to generate panoramas with both accurate distortion and visual appeal. Specifically, we design a DistortNet for distortion guidance by imposing panorama-specific distortion prior and a modified condition registration mechanism; and a ContentNet for content completion by imposing perspective image information. Additionally, a distortion correction loss function with Distort-CLIP is introduced to constrain the distortion explicitly.

The ICL inference process of the attention layer aligns with the training procedure of its  dual model, generating token representation predictions that are equivalent to the dual model's test outputs. We delve into the training process of this  dual model from a representation learning standpoint and further derive a generalization error bound related to the quantity of demonstration tokens.

In contrast, linear attention provides a far more efficient solution by reducing the complexity to linear levels. However, compared to Softmax attention, linear attention often experiences significant performance degradation. Our experiments indicate that this performance drop is due to the low-rank nature of linear attention's feature map, which hinders its ability to adequately model complex spatial information. In this paper, to break the low-rank dilemma of linear attention, we conduct rank analysis from two perspectives: the KV buffer and the output features. Consequently, we introduce Rank-Augmented Linear Attention (RALA), which rivals the performance of Softmax attention while maintaining linear complexity and high efficiency. Based on RALA, we construct the Rank-Augmented Vision Linear Transformer (RAVLT). Extensive experiments demonstrate that RAVLT achieves excellent performance across various vision tasks. Specifically, without using any additional labels, data, or supervision during training, RAVLT achieves an 84.4% Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1k with only 26M parameters and 4.6G FLOPs.

Previous methods primarily focus on developing advanced architectures to facilitate effective audio-visual interactions, without fully addressing the inherent challenges posed by audio natures, \emph{\ie}, (1) feature confusion due to the overlapping nature of audio signals, and (2) audio-visual matching difficulty from the varied sounds produced by the same object. To address these challenges, we propose Dynamic Derivation and Elimination (DDESeg): a novel audio-visual segmentation framework. Specifically, to mitigate feature confusion, DDESeg reconstructs the semantic content of the mixed audio signal by enriching the distinct semantic information of each individual source, deriving representations that preserve the unique characteristics of each sound. To reduce the matching difficulty, we introduce a discriminative feature learning module, which enhances the semantic distinctiveness of generated audio representations. Considering that not all derived audio representations directly correspond to visual features (e.g., off-screen sounds), we propose a dynamic elimination module to filter out non-matching elements. This module facilitates targeted interaction between sounding regions and relevant audio semantics. By scoring the interacted features, we identify and filter out irrelevant audio information, ensuring accurate audio-visual alignment.

Recently 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) has emerged as a highly efficient alternative for object-level 3D generation. However, adapting 3D-GS from finite-scale 3D objects and humans to infinite-scale 3D cities is non-trivial. Unbounded 3D city generation entails significant storage overhead (out-of-memory issues), arising from the need to expand points to billions, often demanding hundreds of Gigabytes of VRAM for a city scene spanning 10km^2. In this paper, we propose GaussianCity, a generative Gaussian Splatting framework dedicated to efficiently synthesizing unbounded 3D cities with a single feed-forward pass. Our key insights are two-fold: 1) Compact 3D Scene Representation: We introduce BEV-Point as a highly compact intermediate representation, ensuring that the growth in VRAM usage for unbounded scenes remains constant, thus enabling unbounded city generation. 2) Spatial-aware Gaussian Attribute Decoder: We present spatial-aware BEV-Point decoder to produce 3D Gaussian attributes, which leverages Point Serializer to integrate the structural and contextual characteristics of BEV points. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GaussianCity achieves state-of-the-art results in both drone-view and street-view 3D city generation.

In this work, we present a unifying framework that enables searching among all linear operators expressible via an Einstein summation. This framework encompasses many previously proposed structures, such as low-rank, Kronecker, Tensor-Train, and Monarch, along with many novel structures. We develop a taxonomy of all such operators based on their computational and algebraic properties, which provides insights into their scaling laws. Combining these insights with empirical evaluation, we identify a subset of structures that achieve equal or better performance than dense layers as a function of training compute. To further improve their compute efficiency, we develop a natural extension of these performant structures that convert them into a sparse Mixture-of-Experts layer.

While the utility of encoding geometric structure has been demonstrated empirically, rigorous analysis of its impact on the learnability of neural networks is largely missing. Several recent results have established hardness results for learning feedforward and equivariant neural networks under i.i.d. Gaussian or uniform Boolean data distributions. In this paper, we investigate the hardness of learning under the manifold hypothesis. We ask, which minimal assumptions on the curvature and regularity of the manifold, if any, render the learning problem efficiently learnable. We prove that learning is hard under input manifolds of bounded curvature by extending proofs of hardness in the SQ and cryptographic settings for boolean data inputs to the geometric setting. On the other hand, we show that additional assumptions on the volume of the data manifold alleviate these fundamental limitations and guarantee learnability via a simple interpolation argument. Notable instances of this regime are manifolds which can be reliably reconstructed via manifold learning.

Traditional silhouette- and pose-based methods, though theoretically effective at removing such distractions, often fall short of high accuracy due to their sparse and less informative inputs. Emerging end-to-end methods address this by directly denoising RGB videos using human priors. Building on this trend, we propose DenoisingGait, a novel gait denoising method. Inspired by the philosophy that ""what I cannot create, I do not understand"", we turn to generative diffusion models, uncovering how they partially filter out irrelevant factors for gait understanding. Additionally, we introduce a geometry-driven Feature Matching module, which, combined with background removal via human silhouettes, condenses the multi-channel diffusion features at each foreground pixel into a two-channel direction vector.

TAPT is a test-time defense method that learns defensive bimodal (textual and visual) prompts to robustify the inference process of CLIP.

We generate such an approximate correspondence using a very simple and efficient strategy, where the new point is the mean point of three corresponding input points. The new solvers are efficient and easy to implement, since they are based on existing efficient minimal solvers, i.e., the 4-point affine fundamental matrix, the well-known 5-point relative pose solver, and the P3P solver.

Patel, Shao-Yuan Lo","Visual instruction tuning (VIT) for large vision-language models (LVLMs) requires training on expansive datasets of image-instruction pairs, which can be costly. Recent efforts in VIT data selection aim to select a small subset of high-quality image-instruction pairs, reducing VIT runtime while maintaining performance comparable to full-scale training. However, a major challenge often overlooked is that generating instructions from unlabeled images for VIT is highly expensive. Most existing VIT datasets rely heavily on human annotations or paid services like the GPT API, which limits users with constrained resources from creating VIT datasets for custom applications. To address this, we introduce Pre-Instruction Data Selection (PreSel), a more practical data selection paradigm that directly selects the most beneficial unlabeled images and generates instructions only for the selected images. PreSel first estimates the relative importance of each vision task within VIT datasets to derive task-wise sampling budgets. It then clusters image features within each task, selecting the most representative images with the budget.

However, the sensitivity of T2V generative models to input prompts highlights the critical role of prompt design in influencing generative outcomes. Prior research has predominantly relied on Large Language Models (LLMs) to align user-provided prompts with the distribution of training prompts, albeit without tailored guidance encompassing prompt vocabulary and sentence structure nuances. To this end, we introduce RAPO, a novel Retrieval-Augmented Prompt Optimization framework. In order to address potential inaccuracies and ambiguous details generated by LLM-generated prompts. RAPO refines the naive prompts through dual optimization branches, selecting the superior prompt for T2V generation. The first branch augments user prompts with diverse modifiers extracted from a learned relational graph, refining them to align with the format of training prompts via a fine-tuned LLM. Conversely, the second branch rewrites the naive prompt using a pre-trained LLM following a well-defined instruction set. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RAPO can effectively enhance both the static and dynamic dimensions of generated videos, demonstrating the significance of prompt optimization for user-provided prompts.",2025-06-01,2,CVPR

In this paradigm, we permit the system to defer a subset of its tasks to the expert. Although there are currently systems that follow this paradigm and are designed to optimize the accuracy of the final human-AI team, the general methodology for developing such systems under a set of constraints (e.g., algorithmic fairness, expert intervention budget, defer of anomaly, etc.) remains largely unexplored. In this paper, using a d-dimensional generalization to the fundamental lemma of Neyman and Pearson (d-GNP), we obtain the Bayes optimal solution for learn-to-defer systems under various constraints. Furthermore, we design a generalizable algorithm to estimate that solution and apply this algorithm to the COMPAS, Hatespeech, and ACSIncome datasets. Our algorithm shows improvements in terms of constraint violation over a set of learn-to-defer baselines and can control multiple constraint violations at once. The use of d-GNP is beyond learn-to-defer applications and can potentially obtain a solution to decision-making problems with a set of controlled expected performance measures.",2024-12-16,2,NeurIPS

Our approach naturally leverages properties of Cramér-Chernoff bounds, such as exact optimization of the free parameter in many PAC-Bayes bounds. We highlight several applications of the main theorem. Firstly, we show that our bound recovers and generalizes previous results. Additionally, our approach allows working with richer assumptions that result in more informative and potentially tighter bounds. In this direction, we provide a general bound under a newmodel-dependentassumption from which we obtain bounds based on parameter norms and log-Sobolev inequalities.

To address these limitations, we propose a new Vision-Centric Transformer (VCT) framework that leverages vision-derived queries to iteratively fetch corresponding audio and visual information, enabling queries to better distinguish between different sounding objects from mixed audio and accurately delineate their contours. Additionally, we also introduce a Prototype Prompted Query Generation (PPQG) module within our VCT framework to generate vision-derived queries that are both semantically aware and visually rich through audio prototype prompting and pixel context grouping, facilitating audio-visual information aggregation.

However, this many-shot multimodal ICL setting has one crucial problem: it is fundamentally limited by the model's context length set at pretraining. The problem is especially prominent in the multimodal domain, which processes both text and images, requiring additional tokens. This motivates the need for a multimodal method to compress many shots into fewer tokens without finetuning. In this work, we enable LMMs to perform multimodal, many-shot in-context learning by leveraging Multimodal Task Vectors (MTV)---compact implicit representations of in-context examples compressed in the model's attention heads. Specifically, we first demonstrate the existence of such MTV in LMMs and then leverage these extracted MTV to enable many-shot in-context learning for various vision-and-language tasks.

Despite their different natures, these strategies often lead to comparable performance gains. However, little is known about whether they induce similar representations inside LLMs.  We approach this problem by analyzing the probability landscape of their hidden representations in the two cases. More specifically, we compare how LLMs solve the same question-answering task, finding that ICL and SFT create very different internal structures, in both cases undergoing a sharp transition in the middle of the network. In the first half of the network, ICL shapes interpretable representations hierarchically organized according to their semantic content. In contrast, the probability landscape obtained with SFT is fuzzier and semantically mixed. In the second half of the model, the fine-tuned representations develop probability modes that better encode the identity of answers, while less-defined peaks characterize the landscape of ICL representations.

Track4Gen merges the video generation and point tracking tasks into a single network by making minimal changes to existing video generation architectures. Using Stable Video Diffusion as a backbone, Track4Gen demonstrates that it is possible to unify video generation and point tracking, which are typically handled as separate tasks.

Although effective, these methods often compromise key semantic information, resulting in suboptimal alignment between visual features and text descriptions. In this work, we present a concise yet effective approach called Patch Generation-to-Selection to enhance CLIP's training efficiency while preserving critical semantic content. Our method introduces a gradual masking process in which a small set of candidate patches is first pre-selected as potential mask regions. Then, we apply Sobel edge detection across the entire image to generate an edge mask that prioritizes the retention of the primary object areas. Finally, similarity scores between the candidate mask patches and their neighboring patches are computed, with optimal transport normalization refining the selection process to ensure a balanced similarity matrix.

The key challenge for ZS-CIR tasks is to modify a reference image according to manipulation text to accurately retrieve a target image, especially when the reference image is missing essential target content. In this paper, we propose a novel prediction-based mapping network, named PrediCIR, to adaptively predict the missing target visual content in reference images in the latent space before mapping for accurate ZS-CIR. Specifically, a world view generation module first constructs a source view by omitting certain visual content of a target view, coupled with an action that includes the manipulation intent derived from existing image-caption pairs. Then, a target content prediction module trains a world model as a predictor to adaptively predict the missing visual information guided by user intention in manipulating text at the latent space.

To this end, we propose a Hierarchical Representation Learning Framework (HRLF) for the MSA task under uncertain missing modalities.

				1129-1137","Materials science text mining (MSTM), involving tasks like property extraction and synthesis action retrieval, is pivotal for advancing research by deriving critical insights from scientific literature. Descriptors, serving as essential task labels, often vary in meaning depending on researchers' usage purposes across different mining tasks. (e.g., 'Material' can refer to both synthesis components and participants in fuel cell experiment). This meaning difference makes it difficult for existing methods, fine-tuned to specific task, to handle the same descriptors in other tasks. To overcome above limitation, we propose MatDuck, a simple and effective approach for Zero-Shot MSTM by evoking material knowledge within Large Language Models (LLMs). Specifically, inspired by the Duck Typing principles in programming languages, we present a ClassDefinition-Style Descriptor generation method that evokes task-specific characteristics to address usage variation. Subsequently, we introduce code-style in-context learning for zero-shot tasks, reframing them into code to leverage LLMs' proficiency in code understanding. Extensive experiments on eight benchmark datasets demonstrate that MatDuck, as a plug-and-play approach, significantly improves the Zero-Shot MSTM performance of LLMs by an average of 11.3% across seven tasks.",2025-04-11,1,AAAI

In this paper, we observe that diffusion models struggle to accurately reconstruct mid-band frequency information in real images, suggesting the limitation could serve as a cue for detecting diffusion model generated images. Motivated by this observation, we propose a novel method called Frequency-guided Reconstruction Error (FIRE), which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to investigate the influence of frequency decomposition on reconstruction error. FIRE assesses the variation in reconstruction error before and after the frequency decomposition, offering a robust method for identifying diffusion model generated images.

In this paper, we hypothesize that learning temporal action abstractions using latent variable models (LVMs), which learn to map data to a compressed latent space and back, is apromising direction towards low-level skills that can readily be used for new tasks. Although several works have attempted to show this, they have generally been limited by architectures that do not faithfully capture sharable representations. To address this we present Quantized Skill Transformer (QueST), which learns a larger and more flexible latent encoding that is more capable of modeling the breadth of low-level skills necessary for a variety of tasks. To make use of this extra flexibility, QueST imparts causal inductive bias from the action sequence data into the latent space, leading to more semantically useful and transferable representations. We compare to state-of-the-art imitation learning and LVM baselines and see that QueST’s architecture leads to strong performance on several multitask and few-shot learning benchmarks.

Recent studies have shown that the transferability of adversarial examples exists for CNNs, and the same holds true for ViTs. However, existing ViT attacks aggressively regularize the largest token gradients to exact zero within each layer of the surrogate model, overlooking the interactions between layers, which limits their transferability in attacking black-box models. Therefore, in this paper, we focus on boosting the transferability of adversarial attacks on ViTs through adaptive token tuning (ATT). Specifically, we propose three optimization strategies: an adaptive gradient re-scaling strategy to reduce the overall variance of token gradients, a self-paced patch out strategy to enhance the diversity of input tokens, and a hybrid token gradient truncation strategy to weaken the effectiveness of attention mechanism. We demonstrate that scaling correction of gradient changes using gradient variance across different layers can produce highly transferable adversarial examples. In addition, introducing attentional truncation can mitigate the overfitting over complex interactions between tokens in deep ViT layers to further improve the transferability. On the other hand, using feature importance as a guidance to discard a subset of perturbation patches in each iteration, along with combining self-paced learning and progressively more sampled attacks, significantly enhances the transferability over attacks that use all perturbation patches. Extensive experiments conducted on ViTs, undefended CNNs, and defended CNNs validate the superiority of our proposed ATT attack method. On average, our approach improves the attack performance by 10.1% compared to state-of-the-art transfer-based attacks. Notably, we achieve the best attack performance with an average of 58.3% on three defended CNNs. Code is available at https://github.com/MisterRpeng/ATT.",2024-12-16,7,NeurIPS

Our approach captures 4D scenes from an online stream of color images with depth measurements or predictions by jointly optimizing scene geometry, appearance, dynamics, and camera ego-motion. Although natural environments exhibit complex non-rigid motions, 4D-SLAM remains relatively underexplored due to its inherent challenges; even with 2.5D signals, the problem is ill-posed because of the high dimensionality of the optimization space. To overcome these challenges, we first introduce a SLAM method based on Gaussian surface primitives that leverages depth signals more effectively than 3D Gaussians, thereby achieving accurate surface reconstruction. To further model non-rigid deformations, we employ a warp-field represented by a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and introduce a novel camera pose estimation technique along with surface regularization terms that facilitate spatio-temporal reconstruction. In addition to these algorithmic challenges, a significant hurdle in 4D SLAM research is the lack of reliable ground truth and evaluation protocols, primarily due to the difficulty of 4D capture using commodity sensors.

Given a dataset that includes both labelled and unlabelled images, GCD aims to categorize all images in the unlabelled subset, regardless of whether they belong to known or unknown classes. In GCD, the common practice typically involves applying a spherical projection operator at the end of the self-supervised pretrained backbone, operating within Euclidean or spherical space. However, both of these spaces have been shown to be suboptimal for encoding samples that possesses hierarchical structures. In contrast, hyperbolic space exhibits exponential volume growth relative to radius, making it inherently strong at capturing the hierarchical structure of samples from both seen and unseen categories. Therefore, we propose to tackle the category discovery challenge in the hyperbolic space. We introduce HypCD, a simple \underline{Hyp}erbolic framework for learning hierarchy-aware representations and classifiers for generalized \underline{C}ategory \underline{D}iscovery.

However, recent works show GNNs are vulnerable to training-time poisoning attacks -- marginally perturbing edges, nodes, or/and node features of training graph(s) can largely degrade GNNs' testing performance. Most previous defenses against graph poisoning attacks are empirical and are soon broken by adaptive / stronger ones. A few provable defenses provide robustness guarantees, but have large gaps when applied in practice: 1) restrict the attacker on only one type of perturbation; 2) design for a particular GNN architecture or task; and 3) robustness guarantees are not 100\% accurate.In this work, we bridge all these gaps by developing PGNNCert, the first certified defense of GNNs against poisoning attacks under arbitrary (edge, node, and node feature) perturbations with deterministic robustness guarantees.

Yu","Brain stimulation has the potential to create desired neural population activity states. However, it is challenging to search the large space of stimulation parameters, for example, selecting which subset of electrodes to be used for stimulation. In this scenario, creating a model that maps the configuration of stimulation parameters to the brain’s response can be beneficial. Training such an expansive model usually requires more stimulation-response samples than can be collected in a given experimental session. Furthermore, changes in the properties of the recorded activity over time can make it challenging to merge stimulation-response samples across sessions. To address these challenges, we propose MiSO (MicroStimulation Optimization), a closed-loop stimulation framework to drive neural population activity toward specified states by optimizing over a large stimulation parameter space. MiSO consists of three key components: 1) a neural activity alignment method to merge stimulation-response samples across sessions, 2) a statistical model trained on the merged samples to predict the brain's response to untested stimulation parameter configurations, and 3) an online optimization algorithm to adaptively update the stimulation parameter configuration based on the model's predictions. In this study, we implemented MiSO with a factor analysis (FA) based alignment method, a convolutional neural network (CNN), and an epsilon greedy optimization algorithm. We tested MiSO in closed-loop experiments using electrical microstimulation in the prefrontal cortex of a non-human primate.

Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) is an effective technique to reduce the memory and computation overhead. Existing PTQ methods mainly focus on large language models (LLMs), without considering the differences across other modalities. In this paper, we discover that there is a significant difference in sensitivity between language and vision tokens in large VLMs. Therefore, treating tokens from different modalities equally, as in existing PTQ methods, may over-emphasize the insensitive modalities, leading to significant accuracy loss. To deal with the above issue, we propose a simple yet effective method, Modality-Balanced Quantization (MBQ), for large VLMs. Specifically, MBQ incorporates the different sensitivities across modalities during the calibration process to minimize the reconstruction loss for better quantization parameters.

Since these matrices lie within the Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) manifold - a Riemannian space with intrinsic non-Euclidean geometry, the primary challenge in representation learning is to respect this underlying geometric structure. Drawing inspiration from the success of Euclidean deep learning, researchers have developed neural networks on the SPD manifolds for more faithful covariance embedding learning. A notable advancement in this area is the implementation of Riemannian batch normalization (RBN), which has been shown to improve the performance of SPD network models. Nonetheless, the Riemannian metric beneath the existing RBN might fail to effectively deal with the ill-conditioned SPD matrices (ICSM), undermining the effectiveness of RBN. In contrast, the Bures-Wasserstein metric (BWM) demonstrates superior performance for ill-conditioning. In addition, the recently introduced Generalized BWM (GBWM) parameterizes the vanilla BWM via an SPD matrix, allowing for a more nuanced representation of vibrant geometries of the SPD manifold.

In this work, we introduce Spatiotemporal Skip Guidance (STG), a simple training-free sampling guidance method for enhancing transformer-based video diffusion models. STG employs an implicit weak model via self-perturbation, avoiding the need for external models or additional training. By selectively skipping spatiotemporal layers, STG produces an aligned, degraded version of the original model to boost sample quality without compromising diversity or dynamic degree. Our contributions include: (1) introducing STG as an efficient, high-performing guidance technique for video diffusion models, (2) eliminating the need for auxiliary models by simulating a weak model through layer skipping, and (3) ensuring quality-enhanced guidance without compromising sample diversity or dynamics unlike CFG.

Despite diffusion-based methods have made significant strides in the field of image inpainting, challenges remain regarding the emergence of unexpected objects or artifacts. We assert that the inexact diffusion pathways established by existing standard optimization paradigms constrain the efficacy of object removal. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel Erase Diffusion, termed EraDiff, aimed at unleashing the potential power of standard diffusion in the context of object removal. In contrast to standard diffusion, the EraDiff adapts both the optimization paradigm and the network to improve the coherence and elimination of the erasure results. We first introduce a Chain-Rectifying Optimization (CRO) paradigm, a sophisticated diffusion process specifically designed to align with the objectives of erasure. This paradigm establishes innovative diffusion transition pathways that simulate the gradual elimination of objects during optimization, allowing the model to accurately capture the intent of object removal. Furthermore, to mitigate deviations caused by artifacts during the sampling pathways, we develop a simple yet effective Self-Rectifying Attention (SRA) mechanism. The SRA calibrates the sampling pathways by altering self-attention activation, allowing the model to effectively bypass artifacts while further enhancing the coherence of the generated content. With this design, our proposed EraDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance on the OpenImages V5 dataset and demonstrates significant superiority in real-world scenarios.",2025-06-01,2,CVPR

We first reveal the existence of the visual anchors in Vision Transformer and propose a cost-effective search algorithm to progressively extract them. Building on these findings, we introduce the Anchor Former (AcFormer), a novel vision-language connector designed to leverage the rich prior knowledge obtained from these visual anchors during pretraining, guiding the aggregation of information. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate that the proposed method significantly reduces computational costs by nearly two-thirds, while simultaneously outperforming baseline methods.

Although current research has thoroughly examined the correctness of the code produced by code generation models, a vital aspect that plays a pivotal role in greencomputing and sustainability efforts — the efficiency of the generated code — has often been neglected. This paper presents Effibench, a benchmark with 1,000 efficiency-critical coding problems to assess the efficiency of code generated by code generation models. EffiBench contains a diverse set of LeetCode coding problems. Each problem is paired with an executable human-written canonical solution, which obtains the SOTA efficiency on the LeetCode solution leaderboard. With EffiBench, we empirically examine the ability of 42 large language models (35 open-source and 7 closed-source) to generate efficient code. Our evaluation results demonstrate that the efficiency of the code generated by LLMs is generally worse than the efficiency of human-written canonical solutions. For example, GPT-4 generated code has an average \textbf{3.12} times execution time that of the human-written canonical solutions. In the most extreme cases, the execution time and total memory usage of GPT-4 code are \textbf{13.89} and \textbf{43.92} times that of the canonical solutions.

In this work, we present a token pruner that uses auxiliary prediction heads that learn to select tokens end-to-end based on task relevance. These auxiliary heads can be removed after training, leading to throughput close to that of a random pruner. We evaluate our method on image classification, semantic segmentation, object detection, and instance segmentation, and show speedups of 1.5 to 4x with small drops in performance. As a best case, on the ADE20k semantic segmentation benchmark, we observe a 2x speedup relative to the no-pruning baseline, with a negligible performance penalty of 0.1 median mIoU across 5 seeds.",2025-06-01,3,CVPR

Motivated by this, we present DyCoke, a training-free token compression method to optimize token representation and accelerate VLLMs. DyCoke incorporates a plug-and-play temporal compression module to minimize temporal redundancy by merging redundant tokens across frames, and applies dynamic KV cache reduction to prune spatially redundant tokens selectively. It ensures high-quality inference by dynamically retaining the critical tokens at each decoding step.

Inpainting is one such application that can benefit significantly from diffusion models. Existing methods either hijack the reverse process of a pretrained diffusion model or cast the problem into a larger framework, \ie, conditioned generation. However, these approaches often require nested loops in the generation process or additional components for conditioning. In this paper, we present region-aware diffusion models (RAD) for inpainting with a simple yet effective reformulation of the vanilla diffusion models. RAD utilizes a different noise schedule for each pixel, which allows local regions to be generated asynchronously while considering the global image context. A plain reverse process requires no additional components, enabling RAD to achieve inference time up to 100 times faster than the state-of-the-art approaches. Moreover, we employ low-rank adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tune RAD based on other pretrained diffusion models, reducing computational burdens in training as well.

However, due to their semantic obscurity and expressive diversity, it is rather challenging to identify them. Existing methods mostly focus on superficial text features, ignoring the associations of hyperbole and metaphor as well as the effect of implicit emotion on perceiving these rhetorical devices. To implement these hypotheses, we propose an emotion-guided hyperbole and metaphor detection framework based on bidirectional dynamic interaction (EmoBi). Firstly, the emotion analysis module deeply mines the emotion connotations behind hyperbole and metaphor. Next, the emotion-based domain mapping module identifies the target and source domains to gain a deeper understanding of the implicit meanings of hyperbole and metaphor. Finally, the bidirectional dynamic interaction module enables the mutual promotion between hyperbole and metaphor. Meanwhile, a verification mechanism is designed to ensure detection accuracy and reliability. Experiments show that EmoBi outperforms all baseline methods on four datasets. Specifically, compared to the current SoTA, the F1 score increased by 28.1% for hyperbole detection on the TroFi dataset and 23.1% for metaphor detection on the HYPO-L dataset.

Current text-driven human avatar generation methods either model hair, clothing, and the human body using a unified geometry or produce hair and garments that are not easily adaptable for simulation within existing simulation pipelines. The primary challenge lies in representing the hair and garment geometry in a way that allows leveraging established prior knowledge from foundational image diffusion models (e.g., Stable Diffusion) while being simulation-ready using either physics or neural simulators. To address this task, we propose a two-stage framework that combines the flexibility of 3D Gaussians with simulation-ready hair strands and garment meshes. Specifically, we first employ three text-conditioned 3D generative models to generate garment mesh, body shape and hair strands from the given text prompt. To leverage prior knowledge from foundational diffusion models, we attach 3D Gaussians to the body mesh, garment mesh, as well as hair strands and learn the avatar appearance through optimization. To drive the avatar given a pose sequence, we first apply physics simulators onto the garment meshes and hair strands. We then transfer the motion onto 3D Gaussians through carefully designed mechanisms for each body part. As a result, our synthesized avatars have vivid texture and realistic dynamic motion. To the best of our knowledge, our method is the first to produce highly realistic, fully simulation-ready 3D avatars, surpassing the capabilities of current approaches.",2025-06-01,2,CVPR

Recent years have witnessed significant breakthroughs in first-order methods, such as gradient descent, for tackling this non-convex optimization problem. However, the presence of numerous saddle points often prolongs the time required for gradient descent to overcome these obstacles. Moreover, overparameterization can markedly decelerate gradient descent methods, transitioning its convergence rate from linear to sub-linear.  In this paper, we introduce an approximated Gauss-Newton (AGN) method for tackling the non-convex LRMS problem. Notably, AGN incurs a computational cost comparable to gradient descent per iteration but converges much faster without being slowed down by saddle points. We prove that, despite the non-convexity of the objective function, AGN achieves Q-linear convergence from random initialization to the global optimal solution. The global Q-linear convergence of AGN represents a substantial enhancement over the convergence of the existing methods for the overparameterized non-convex LRMS.

The challenge is further compounded by the inherently disordered and sparse nature of 3D point cloud data. In response to those predicaments, we introduce an innovative approach that emphasizes learning point offsets, targeting more informative pseudo-abnormal points, thus fostering more effective distillation of normal data representations. We also have crafted an augmentation technique that is steered by normal vectors, facilitating the creation of credible pseudo anomalies that enhance the efficiency of the training process.

As T2I models require extensive data and computational resources for training, they constitute highly valued intellectual property (IP) for their legitimate owners, yet making them incentive targets for unauthorized fine-tuning by adversaries seeking to leverage these models for customized, usually profitable applications. Existing IP protection methods for diffusion models generally involve embedding watermark patterns and then verifying ownership through generated outputs examination, or inspecting the model's feature space. However, these techniques are inherently ineffective in practical scenarios when the watermarked model undergoes fine-tuning, and the feature space is inaccessible during verification ((i.e., black-box setting). The model is prone to forgetting the previously learned watermark knowledge when it adapts to a new task. To address this challenge, we propose SleeperMark, a novel framework designed to embed resilient watermarks into T2I diffusion models. SleeperMark explicitly guides the model to disentangle the watermark information from the semantic concepts it learns, allowing the model to retain the embedded watermark while continuing to be adapted to new downstream tasks. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of SleeperMark across various types of diffusion models, including latent diffusion models (e.g., Stable Diffusion) and pixel diffusion models (e.g., DeepFloyd-IF), showing robustness against downstream fine-tuning and various attacks at both the image and model levels, with minimal impact on the model's generative capability.

This paper explores how LLMs can transition to interactive, question-driven learning through student-teacher dialogues. We introduce INTERACT (INTERactive learning for Adaptive Concept Transfer), a framework in which a “student” LLM engages a “teacher” LLM through iterative inquiries to acquire knowledge across 1,347 contexts, including song lyrics, news articles, movie plots, academic papers, and images. Our experiments show that across a wide range of scenarios and LLM architectures, interactive learning consistently enhances performance, achieving up to a 25% improvement, with ‘cold-start’ student models matching static learning baselines in as few as five dialogue turns. Interactive setups can also mitigate the disadvantages of weaker teachers, showcasing the robustness of question-driven learning.",2025-07-01,1,ACL

However, due to the low resolution and unclear parcel boundaries, annotating pixel-level masks is exceptionally complex and time-consuming in SITS. This paper embraces the weakly supervised paradigm (i.e., only image-level categories available) to liberate the crop mapping task from the exhaustive annotation burden. The unique characteristics of SITS give rise to several challenges in weakly supervised learning: (1) noise perturbation from spatially neighboring regions, and (2) erroneous semantic bias from anomalous temporal periods. To address the above difficulties, we propose a novel method, termed exploring space-time perceptive clues (Exact). First, we introduce a set of spatial clues to explicitly capture the representative patterns of different crops from the most class-relative regions. Besides, we leverage the temporal-to-class interaction of the model to emphasize the contributions of pivotal clips, thereby enhancing the model perception for crop regions. Build upon the space-time perceptive clues, we derive the clue-based CAMs to effectively supervise the SITS segmentation network. Our method demonstrates impressive performance on various SITS benchmarks. Remarkably, the segmentation network trained on Exact-generated masks achieves 95% of its fully supervised performance, showing the bright promise of weakly supervised paradigm in crop mapping scenario.

However, these approximators introduce challenges due to the non-stationary nature of RL training. One source of the challenges in RL is that output predictions can churn, leading to uncontrolled changes after each batch update for states not included in the batch. Although such a churn phenomenon exists in each step of network training, it remains under-explored on how churn occurs and impacts RL. In this work, we start by characterizing churn in a view of Generalized Policy Iteration with function approximation, and we discover a chain effect of churn that leads to a cycle where the churns in value estimation and policy improvement compound and bias the learning dynamics throughout the iteration. Further, we concretize the study and focus on the learning issues caused by the chain effect in different settings, including greedy action deviation in value-based methods, trust region violation in proximal policy optimization, and dual bias of policy value in actor-critic methods. We then propose a method to reduce the chain effect across different settings, called Churn Approximated ReductIoN (CHAIN), which can be easily plugged into most existing DRL algorithms. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in both reducing churn and improving learning performance across online and offline, value-based and policy-based RL settings.",2024-12-16,7,NeurIPS

Recent efforts typically adopt the Masked Video Modeling (MVM) paradigm, leading to significant progress on multiple video tasks. However, two critical challenges remain: 1) Without human annotations, the random temporal sampling introduces uncertainty, increasing the difficulty of model training. 2) Previous MVM methods primarily recover the masked patches in the pixel space, leading to insufficient information compression for downstream tasks. To address these challenges jointly, we propose a self-supervised framework that leverages Temporal Correspondence for video Representation learning (T-CoRe). For challenge 1), we propose a sandwich sampling strategy that selects two auxiliary frames to reduce reconstruction uncertainty in a two-side-squeezing manner. Addressing challenge 2), we introduce an auxiliary branch into a self-distillation architecture to restore representations in the latent space, generating high-level semantic representations enriched with temporal information. Experiments of T-CoRe consistently present superior performance across several downstream tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness for video representation learning.

Typically, current open-source MLLMs rely on the alignment inherited from their language module to avoid harmful generations. However, the lack of safety measures specifically designed for multi-modal inputs creates an alignment gap, leaving MLLMs vulnerable to vision-domain attacks such as typographic manipulation. Current methods utilize a carefully designed safety dataset to enhance model defense capability, while the specific knowledge or patterns acquired from the high-quality dataset remain unclear. Through comparison experiments, we find that the alignment gap primarily arises from data distribution biases, while image content, response quality, or the contrastive behavior of the dataset makes little contribution to boosting multi-modal safety. To further investigate this and identify the key factors in improving MLLM safety, we propose finetuning MLLMs on a small set of benign instruct-following data with responses replaced by simple, clear rejection sentences. Experiments show that, without the need for labor-intensive collection of high-quality malicious data, model safety can still be significantly improved, as long as a specific fraction of rejection data exists in the finetuning set, indicating the security alignment is not lost but rather obscured during multi-modal pretraining or instruction finetuning. Simply correcting the underlying data bias could narrow the safety gap in the vision domain.",2025-06-01,1,CVPR

				1219-1227","Spatially Resolved Transcriptomics (SRT) has become an indispensable tool in various fields, including tumor microenvironment identification, neurobiology, and the study of complex tissue architecture.  However, the accuracy of these insights is often compromised by noise in spatial transcriptomics data due to technical limitations. While recent advancements in denoising methods have shown some promise, they frequently fall short by neglecting spatial features, overlooking the variability in noise levels among genes, and relying heavily on external histological images for supplementary information. In our study, we propose DUSTED, a Dual-Attention Enhanced Spatial Transcriptomics Denoiser, designed to address these challenges. Built on a graph autoencoder framework, DUSTED utilizes gene channel attention and graph attention mechanisms to simultaneously consider spatial features and noise variability in gene expression data. Additionally, it integrates the negative binomial distribution with or without zero-inflation, ensuring a more accurate fit for gene expression distributions. Benchmark tests using simulated datasets demonstrate that DUSTED outperforms existing methods. Furthermore, in real-world applications with the HOCWTA and DLPFC datasets, DUSTED excels in enhancing the correlation between gene and protein expression, recovering spatial gene expression patterns, and improving clustering results.

Aiming to make progress in this direction, the Melting Pot contest 2023 focused on the problem of cooperation among interacting agents and challenged researchers to push the boundaries of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) for mixed-motive games. The contest leveraged the Melting Pot environment suite to rigorously evaluate how well agents can adapt their cooperative skills to interact with novel partners in unforeseen situations. Unlike other reinforcement learning challenges, this challenge focused on social rather than environmental generalization. In particular, a population of agents performs well in Melting Pot when its component individuals are adept at finding ways to cooperate both with others in their population and with strangers. Thus Melting Pot measures cooperative intelligence.The contest attracted over 600 participants across 100+ teams globally and was a success on multiple fronts: (i) it contributed to our goal of pushing the frontiers of MARL towards building more cooperatively intelligent agents, evidenced by several submissions that outperformed established baselines; (ii) it attracted a diverse range of participants, from independent researchers to industry affiliates and academic labs, both with strong background and new interest in the area alike, broadening the field’s demographic and intellectual diversity; and (iii) analyzing the submitted agents provided important insights, highlighting areas for improvement in evaluating agents' cooperative intelligence.

Black, Silvia Zuffi","The idea of 3D reconstruction as scene understanding is foundational in computer vision. Reconstructing 3D scenes from 2D visual observations requires strong priors to disambiguate structure. Much work has been focused on the anthropocentric, which, characterized by smooth surfaces, coherent normals, and regular edges, allows for the integration of strong geometric inductive biases. Here, we consider a more challenging problem where such assumptions do not hold: the reconstruction of natural scenes containing trees, bushes, boulders, and animals. While numerous works have attempted to tackle the problem of reconstructing animals in the wild, they have focused solely on the animal, neglecting environmental context. This limits their usefulness for analysis tasks, as animals exist inherently within the 3D world, and information is lost when environmental factors are disregarded. We propose a method to reconstruct natural scenes from single images. We base our approach on recent advances leveraging the strong world priors ingrained in Large Language Models and train an autoregressive model to decode a CLIP embedding into a structured compositional scene representation, encompassing both animals and the wild (RAW). To enable this, we propose a synthetic dataset comprising one million images and thousands of assets.

To ensure content consistency across adjacent frames, we enhance the diffusion model with a global spatio-temporal attention mechanism using the Video State-Space block with a 3D Selective Scan module, which reinforces coherence at an affordable computational cost. To further reduce artifacts in generated details, we introduce a self-supervised ControlNet that leverages HR features as guidance and employs contrastive learning to extract degradation-insensitive features from LR videos. Finally, a three-stage training strategy based on a mixture of HR-LR videos is proposed to stabilize VSR training.

Two dominant approaches in this field are AutoRegressive (AR) models and Diffusion Models (DMs). However, genomic sequences are functionally heterogeneous, consisting of multiple connected regions (e.g., Promoter Regions, Exons, and Introns) where elements within each region come from the same probability distribution, but the overall sequence is non-homogeneous. This heterogeneous nature presents challenges for a single model to accurately generate genomic sequences. In this paper, we analyze the properties of AR models and DMs in heterogeneous genomic sequence generation, pointing out crucial limitations in both methods: (i) AR models capture the underlying distribution of data by factorizing and learning the transition probability but fail to capture the global property of DNA sequences. (ii) DMs learn to recover the global distribution but tend to produce errors at the base pair level. To overcome the limitations of both approaches, we propose a post-training sampling method, termed Absorb & Escape (A&E) to perform compositional generation from AR models and DMs. This approach starts with samples generated by DMs and refines the sample quality using an AR model through the alternation of the Absorb and Escape steps.  To assess the quality of generated sequences, we conduct extensive experiments on 15 species for conditional and unconditional DNA generation. The experiment results from motif distribution, diversity checks, and genome integration tests unequivocally show that A&E outperforms state-of-the-art AR models and DMs in genomic sequence generation. A&E does not suffer from the slowness of traditional MCMC to sample from composed distributions with Energy-Based Models whilst it obtains higher quality samples than single models. Our research sheds light on the limitations of current single-model approaches in DNA generation and provides a simple but effective solution for heterogeneous sequence generation.

However, adapting to some complex domains remains challenging, especially when these domains require substantial paired data to capture the targeted distributions. Since unpaired data from a single modality, such as vision or language, is more readily available, we utilize the bidirectional mappings between vision and language learned by the unified generative model to enable training on unpaired data for domain adaptation. Specifically, we propose DoraCycle, which integrates two multimodal cycles: text-to-image-to-text and image-to-text-to-image. The model is optimized through cross-entropy loss computed at the cycle endpoints, where both endpoints share the same modality. This facilitates self-evolution of the model without reliance on annotated text-image pairs. Experimental results demonstrate that for tasks independent of paired knowledge, such as stylization, DoraCycle can effectively adapt the unified model using only unpaired data. For tasks involving new paired knowledge, such as specific identities, a combination of a small set of paired image-text examples and larger-scale unpaired data is sufficient for effective domain-oriented adaptation.

The key idea is to incorporate a public vision-language model (CLIP) to distill positive knowledge while refining negative knowledge for adaptation by self-promotion gradient direction alignment. To that end, knowledge dissemination, separation, and distillation are carried out successively. Knowledge dissemination combines knowledge from cloud detector and CLIP model to initialize a target detector and a CLIP detector in target domain. By matching CLIP detector with the cloud detector, knowledge separation categorizes detections into three parts: consistent, inconsistent and private detections such that divide-and-conquer strategy can be used for knowledge distillation. Consistent and private detections are directly used to train target detector; while inconsistent detections are fused based on a consistent knowledge generation network, which is trained by aligning the gradient direction of inconsistent detections to that of consistent detections, because it provides a direction toward an optimal target detector.

Distributed training, particularly through Sharded Data Parallelism (ShardedDP) which partitions optimizer states among workers, has emerged as a crucial technique to mitigate training time and memory usage. Yet, a major challenge in the scalability of ShardedDP is the intensive communication of weights and gradients. While compression techniques can alleviate this issue, they often result in worse accuracy. Driven by this limitation, we propose SDP4Bit (Toward 4Bit Communication Quantization in Sharded Data Parallelism for LLM Training), which effectively reduces the communication of weights and gradients to nearly 4 bits via two novel techniques: quantization on weight differences, and two-level gradient smooth quantization. Furthermore, SDP4Bit presents an algorithm-system co-design with runtime optimization to minimize the computation overhead of compression. Additional to the theoretical guarantees of convergence, we empirically evaluate the accuracy of SDP4Bit on the pre-training of GPT models with up to 6.7 billion parameters, and the results demonstrate a negligible impact on training loss.

To verify the effectiveness of HumanVid, we establish a baseline model namedCamAnimate, short for Camera-controllable Human Animation, that considers both human and camera motions as conditions. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate that such simple baseline training on our HumanVid achieves state-of-the-art performance in controlling both human pose and camera motions, setting a new benchmark.

However, when it comes to human-centric text-to-image generation, particularly in the context of faces and hands, the results often fall short of naturalness due to insufficient training priors. We alleviate the issue in this work from two perspectives. 1) From the data aspect, we carefully collect a human-centric dataset comprising over one million high-quality human-in-the-scene images and two specific sets of close-up images of faces and hands. These datasets collectively provide a rich prior knowledge base to enhance the human-centric image generation capabilities of the diffusion model. 2) On the methodological front, we propose a simple yet effective method called Mixture of Low-rank Experts (MoLE) by considering low-rank modules trained on close-up hand and face images respectively as experts. This concept draws inspiration from our observation of low-rank refinement, where a low-rank module trained by a customized close-up dataset has the potential to enhance the corresponding image part when applied at an appropriate scale. To validate the superiority of MoLE in the context of human-centric image generation compared to state-of-the-art, we construct two benchmarks and perform evaluations with diverse metrics and human studies.

In this work, we present an elastic inference method for 3DGS. Given an input for the desired model size, our method selects and transforms a subset of Gaussians, achieving substantial rendering performance without additional fine-tuning.

Leveraging importance sampling principles and multi-agent collaboration, FACT-AUDIT generates adaptive and scalable datasets, performs iterative model-centric evaluations, and updates assessments based on model-specific responses.

Q-learning algorithms struggle with extrapolation errors in offline settings, while supervised learning methods are constrained by model expressiveness. Recently, diffusion models (DMs) have shown promise in overcoming these limitations in single-agent learning, but their application in multi-agent scenarios remains unclear. Generating trajectories for each agent with independent DMs may impede coordination, while concatenating all agents’ information can lead to low sample efficiency. Accordingly, we propose MADiff, which is realized with an attention-based diffusion model to model the complex coordination among behaviors of multiple agents. To our knowledge, MADiff is the first diffusion-based multi-agent learning framework, functioning as both a decentralized policy and a centralized controller. During decentralized executions, MADiff simultaneously performs teammate modeling, and the centralized controller can also be applied in multi-agent trajectory predictions.

Traditional methods achieve this by explicitly disentangling style and content from the source image and then fusing the style with the target content, while ensuring content consistency using a pre-trained recognition model. Despite notable progress, these methods suffer from complex pipelines, leading to suboptimal performance in complex scenarios. In this work, we introduce Recognition-Synergistic Scene Text Editing (RS-STE), a novel approach that fully exploits the intrinsic synergy of text recognition for editing. Our model seamlessly integrates text recognition with text editing within a unified framework, and leverages the recognition model's ability to implicitly disentangle style and content while ensuring content consistency. Specifically, our approach employs a multi-modal parallel decoder based on transformer architecture, which predicts both text content and stylized images in parallel. Additionally, our cyclic self-supervised fine-tuning strategy enables effective training on unpaired real-world data without ground truth, enhancing style and content consistency through a twice-cyclic generation process.

This has inspired an intriguing question: if these models cannot plan well, can they still contribute to the planning framework as a helpful plan evaluator? In this work, we generalize this question to consider LLMs augmented with visual understanding, i.e., Vision-Language Models (VLMs). We introduce PathEval, a novel benchmark evaluating VLMs as plan evaluators in complex path-planning scenarios. Succeeding in the benchmark requires a VLM to be able to abstract traits of optimal paths from the scenario description, demonstrate precise low-level perception on each path, and integrate this information to decide the better path. Our analysis of state-of-the-art VLMs reveals that these models face significant challenges on the benchmark. We observe that the VLMs can precisely abstract given scenarios to identify the desired traits and exhibit mixed performance in integrating the provided information. Yet, their vision component presents a critical bottleneck, with models struggling to perceive low-level details about a path. Our experimental results show that this issue cannot be trivially addressed via end-to-end fine-tuning; rather, task-specific discriminative adaptation of these vision encoders is needed for these VLMs to become effective path evaluators.",2025-06-01,2,CVPR

However, existing methods suffer from complex and cumbersome alternating optimization, limiting performance and scalability. To this end, we propose a novel intent learning method termed \underline{ELCRec}, by unifying behavior representation learning into an \underline{E}nd-to-end \underline{L}earnable \underline{C}lustering framework, for effective and efficient \underline{Rec}ommendation. Concretely, we encode user behavior sequences and initialize the cluster centers (latent intents) as learnable neurons. Then, we design a novel learnable clustering module to separate different cluster centers, thus decoupling users' complex intents. Meanwhile, it guides the network to learn intents from behaviors by forcing behavior embeddings close to cluster centers. This allows simultaneous optimization of recommendation and clustering via mini-batch data. Moreover, we propose intent-assisted contrastive learning by using cluster centers as self-supervision signals, further enhancing mutual promotion. Both experimental results and theoretical analyses demonstrate the superiority of ELCRec from six perspectives. Compared to the runner-up, ELCRec improves NDCG@5 by 8.9\% and reduces computational costs by 22.5\% on the Beauty dataset.

Unfortunately, existing 3D evaluation metrics often overlook the geometric quality of generated assets or merely rely on black-box multimodal large language models for coarse assessment. In this paper, we introduce Eval3D, a fine-grained, interpretable evaluation tool that can faithfully evaluate the quality of generated 3D assets based on various distinct yet complementary criteria. Our key observation is that many desired properties of 3D generation, such as semantic and geometric consistency, can be effectively captured by measuring the consistency among various foundation models and tools. We thus leverage a diverse set of models and tools as probes to evaluate the inconsistency of generated 3D assets across different aspects.

However, current methods have two limitations: 1) struggle to handle multi-subjects videos, failing to transfer specific subject motion; 2) struggle to preserve the diversity and accuracy of motion as transferring to subjects with varying shapes. To overcome these, we introduce \textbf{ConMo}, a zero-shot framework that disentangle and recompose the motions of subjects and camera movements. ConMo isolates individual subject and background motion cues from complex trajectories in source videos using only subject masks, and reassembles them for target video generation. This approach enables more accurate motion control across diverse subjects and improves performance in multi-subject scenarios. Additionally, we propose soft guidance in the recomposition stage which controls the retention of original motion to adjust shape constraints, aiding subject shape adaptation and semantic transformation. Unlike previous methods, ConMo unlocks a wide range of applications, including subject size and position editing, subject removal, semantic modifications, and camera motion simulation.

To apply single-scale ViTs to image segmentation, existing methods adopt a convolutional adapter to generate multi-scale features, a pixel decoder to fuse these features, and a Transformer decoder that uses the fused features to make predictions. In this paper, we show that the inductive biases introduced by these task-specific components can instead be learned by the ViT itself, given sufficiently large models and extensive pre-training. Based on these findings, we introduce the Encoder-only Mask Transformer (EoMT), which repurposes the plain ViT architecture to conduct image segmentation. With large-scale models and pre-training, EoMT obtains a segmentation accuracy similar to state-of-the-art models that use task-specific components. At the same time, EoMT is significantly faster than these methods due to its architectural simplicity, e.g., up to 4x faster with ViT-L. Across a range of model sizes, EoMT demonstrates an optimal balance between segmentation accuracy and prediction speed, suggesting that compute resources are better spent on scaling the ViT itself rather than adding architectural complexity.

Prior research often relies on a single visual encoder for both tasks, such as Chameleon. However, due to the differing levels of information granularity required by multimodal understanding and generation, this approach can lead to suboptimal performance, particularly in multimodal understanding. To address this issue, we decouple visual encoding into separate pathways, while still leveraging a single, unified transformer architecture for processing. The decoupling not only alleviates the conflict between the visual encoder's roles in understanding and generation, but also enhances the framework's flexibility. For instance, both the multimodal understanding and generation components can independently select their most suitable encoding methods. Experiments show that Janus surpasses previous unified model and matches or exceeds the performance of task-specific models. The simplicity, high flexibility, and effectiveness of Janus make it a strong candidate for next-generation unified multimodal models.",2025-06-01,178,CVPR

Compared to previous methods based on self-attention or cross-attention alone, our guidance is more effective in eliminating subject mixing. What's more, our guidance addresses subject mixing for all relevant patches beyond the most discriminant one, e.g., the beak of a bird. For each subject, we aggregate self-attention maps of patches with higher cross-attention values. Thus, the aggregated self-attention map forms a region that the whole subject attends to. Our training-free method boosts the performance of both Unet-based and Transformer-based diffusion models such as the Stable Diffusion series.

To address these challenges, we propose OSLOPROMPT, an advanced prompt-learning framework for CLIP with two core innovations. First, to manage limited supervision across source domains and improve DG, we introduce a domain-agnostic prompt-learning mechanism that integrates adaptable domain-specific cues and visually guided semantic attributes through a novel cross-attention module, besides being supported by learnable domain- and class-generic visual prompts to enhance cross-modal adaptability. Second, to improve outlier rejection during inference, we classify unfamiliar samples as ""unknown"" and train specialized prompts with systematically synthesized pseudo-open samples that maintain fine-grained relationships to known classes, generated through a targeted query strategy with off-the-shelf foundation models. This strategy enhances feature learning, enabling our model to detect open samples with varied granularity more effectively.

However, variations in appearance and positioning often complicate the alignment of these references with the test image, limiting detection accuracy. We observe that most anomalies manifest as local variations, meaning that even within anomalous images, valuable normal information remains. We argue that this information is useful and may be more aligned with the anomalies since both the anomalies and the normal information originate from the same image. Therefore, rather than relying on external normality from the training set, we propose INP-Former, a novel method that extracts Intrinsic Normal Prototypes (INPs) directly from the test image. Specifically, we introduce the INP Extractor, which linearly combines normal tokens to represent INPs. We further propose an INP Coherence Loss to ensure INPs can faithfully represent normality for the testing image.

In this paper, we present a Lighting Controllable Video Diffusion model (LCVD) for high-fidelity, relightable portrait animation. We address this limitation by distinguishing these feature types through dedicated subspaces within the feature space of a pre-trained image-to-video diffusion model. Specifically, we employ the 3D mesh, pose, and lighting-rendered shading hints of the portrait to represent the extrinsic attributes, while the reference represents the intrinsic attributes. In the training phase, we employ a reference adapter to map the reference into the intrinsic feature subspace and a shading adapter to map the shading hints into the extrinsic feature subspace. By merging features from these subspaces, the model achieves nuanced control over lighting, pose, and expression in generated animations.

However, there are few studies on 3D indoor scene generation with VLMs. This paper considers this task as a planning problem subject to spatial and layout common sense constraints. To solve the problem with a VLM, we propose a new global-local tree search algorithm. Globally, the method places each object sequentially and explores multiple placements during each placement process, where the problem space is represented as a tree. To reduce the depth of the tree, we decompose the scene structure hierarchically, i.e. room level, region level, floor object level, and supported object level. The algorithm independently generates the floor objects in different regions and supported objects placed on different floor objects. Locally, we also decompose the sub-task, the placement of each object, into multiple steps. The algorithm searches the tree of problem space. To leverage the VLM model to produce positions of objects, we discretize the top-down view space as a dense grid and fill each cell with diverse emojis to make to cells distinct. We prompt the VLM with the emoji grid and the VLM produces a reasonable location for the object by describing the position with the name of emojis.

To this end, we manually construct a benchmark with 12 categories and design evaluation metrics that assess the degree of error in MLLM responses even when the visual content is seemingly understood. Based on this benchmark, we test 15 leading MLLMs and analyze the distribution of attention maps and logits of some MLLMs. Our investigation identifies two primary issues: 1) most instruction tuning datasets predominantly feature questions that 'directly' relate to the visual content, leading to a bias in MLLMs' responses to other indirect questions, and 2) MLLMs' attention to visual tokens is notably lower than to system and question tokens. We further observe that attention scores between questions and visual tokens as well as the model's confidence in the answers are lower in response to misleading questions than to straightforward ones. To address the first challenge, we introduce a paired positive and negative data construction pipeline to diversify the dataset. For the second challenge, we propose to enhance the model's focus on visual content during decoding by refining the text and visual prompt. For the text prompt, we propose a content guided refinement strategy that performs preliminary visual content analysis to generate structured information before answering the question.

Yet, these sparse LiDARs struggle with scene coverage on limited input views, leaving large gaps in depth information. In this work, we propose using an alternative class of ""blurred"" LiDAR that emits a diffuse flash, greatly improving scene coverage but introducing spatial ambiguity from mixed time-of-flight measurements across a wide field of view. To handle these ambiguities, we propose leveraging the complementary strengths of diffuse LiDAR with RGB.

Apart from the independence of $X^*$, we only require a small fraction entries of $\eta$ to have magnitude at most $1$. The \emph{adaptive adversary} is allowed to arbitrarily corrupt an $\varepsilon$-fraction of the samples $(X_1^*, y_1^*),\ldots, (X_n^*, y_n^*)$.Given the $\varepsilon$-corrupted samples $(X_1, y_1),\ldots, (X_n, y_n)$, the goal is to estimate $\beta^*$.  We assume that the rows of $X^*$ are iid samples from some $d$-dimensional distribution $\mathcal{D}$  with zero mean and (unknown) covariance matrix $\Sigma$ with bounded condition number.We design several robust algorithms that outperform the state of the art even in the special case of Gaussian noise $\eta \sim N(0,1)^n$. In particular, we provide a polynomial-time algorithm that with high probability recovers $\beta^*$ up to error $O(\sqrt{\varepsilon})$  as long as  $n \ge \tilde{O}(k^2/\varepsilon)$, only assuming some bounds on the third and the fourth moments of $\mathcal{D}$. In addition, prior to this work, even in the special case of Gaussian design $\mathcal{D} = N(0,\Sigma)$ and noise $\eta \sim N(0,1)$, no polynomial time algorithm was known to achieve error $o(\sqrt{\varepsilon})$ in the sparse setting $n < d^2$.  We show that under some assumptions on the fourth and the eighth moments of $\mathcal{D}$, there is a polynomial-time algorithm that achieves error $o(\sqrt{\varepsilon})$ as long as $n \ge \tilde{O}(k^4 / \varepsilon^3)$.

To fill this gap, our work introduces a theoretical framework that explains the capacity property of sinusoidal networks and offers robust control mechanisms for initialization and training. Our analysis is based on a novel amplitude-phase expansion of the sinusoidal multilayer perceptron, showing how its layer compositions produce a large number of new frequencies expressed as integer combinations of the input frequencies. This relationship can be directly used to initialize the input neurons, as a form of spectral sampling, and to bound the network's spectrum while training.

To address these issues, we introduce ActNet, a scalable deep learning model that builds on the KST and overcomes some of the drawbacks of Kolmogorov's original formulation. We evaluate ActNet in the context of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), a framework well-suited for leveraging KST's strengths in low-dimensional function approximation, particularly for simulating partial differential equations (PDEs). In this challenging setting, where models must learn latent functions without direct measurements, ActNet consistently outperforms KANs across multiple benchmarks and is competitive against the current best MLP-based approaches.

The Pareto front identifies the set of policies that cannot be dominated, providing a foundation for finding Pareto optimal solutions that can efficiently adapt to various preferences.
However, finding the Pareto front is a highly challenging problem. Most existing methods either (i) rely on traversing the *continuous preference space*, which is impractical and results in approximations that are difficult to evaluate against the true Pareto front, or (ii) focus solely on deterministic Pareto optimal policies, from which there are no known techniques to characterize the full Pareto front. Moreover, finding the structure of the Pareto front itself remains unclear even in the context of dynamic programming, where the MDP is fully known in advance.
In this work, we address the challenge of efficiently discovering the Pareto front, involving both deterministic and stochastic Pareto optimal policies.
By investigating the geometric structure of the Pareto front in MO-MDPs, we uncover a key property: the Pareto front is on the boundary of a convex polytope whose vertices all correspond to deterministic policies, and neighboring vertices of the Pareto front differ by only one state-action pair of the deterministic policy, almost surely.
This insight transforms the global comparison across all policies into a localized search among deterministic policies that differ by only one state-action pair, drastically reducing the complexity of searching for the exact Pareto front. 
We develop an efficient algorithm that identifies the vertices of the Pareto front by solving a single-objective MDP only once and then traversing the edges of the Pareto front, making it more efficient than existing methods. Furthermore, the entire Pareto front can be found in $V$ iterations, where $V$ represents the number of vertices on the Pareto front.
Our empirical studies demonstrate the effectiveness of our theoretical strategy in discovering the Pareto front efficiently.",2024-10-04,2,ICLR

				246-254","Accurately measuring protein-RNA binding affinity is crucial in many biological processes and drug design. Previous computational methods for protein-RNA binding affinity prediction rely on either sequence or structure features, unable to capture the binding mechanisms comprehensively.

Unlike prior studies in static settings, this paper explores backdoor attacks in LVLM instruction tuning across mismatched training and testing domains. We introduce a new evaluation dimension, backdoor domain generalization, to assess attack robustness under visual and text domain shifts. Our findings reveal two insights: (1) backdoor generalizability improves when distinctive trigger patterns are independent of specific data domains or model architectures, and (2) the competitive interaction between trigger patterns and clean semantic regions, where guiding the model to predict triggers enhances attack generalizability. Based on these insights, we propose a multimodal attribution backdoor attack (MABA) that injects domain-agnostic triggers into critical areas using attributional interpretation. Experiments with OpenFlamingo, Blip-2, and Otter show that MABA significantly boosts the attack success rate of generalization by 36.4%, achieving a 97% success rate at a 0.2% poisoning rate.

This has motivated a series of papers that analyze tractable synthetic domains and postulate precise mechanisms that may underlie ICL. However, the use of relatively distinct setups that often lack a sequence modeling nature to them makes it unclear how general the reported insights from such studies are. Motivated by this, we propose a synthetic sequence modeling task that involves learning to simulate a finite mixture of Markov chains. As we show, models trained on this task reproduce most well-known results on ICL, hence offering a unified setting for studying the concept. Building on this setup, we demonstrate we can explain a model’s behavior by decomposing it into four broad algorithms that combine a fuzzy retrieval vs. inference approach with either unigram or bigram statistics of the context. These algorithms engage in a competitive dynamics to dominate model behavior, with the precise experimental conditions dictating which algorithm ends up superseding others: e.g., we find merely varying context size or amount of training yields (at times sharp) transitions between which algorithm dictates the model behavior, revealing a mechanism that explains the transient nature of ICL. In this sense, we argue ICL is best thought of as a mixture of different algorithms, each with its own peculiarities, instead of a monolithic capability. This also implies that making general claims about ICL that hold universally across all settings may be infeasible.",2024-10-04,24,ICLR

However, unlike in vision and natural language domains, evaluating generative models for dynamic graphs is challenging due to the difficulty of visualizing their output, making quantitative metrics essential. In this work, we develop a new quality metric for evaluating generative models of dynamic graphs. Current metrics for dynamic graphs typically involve discretizing the continuous-evolution of graphs into static snapshots and then applying conventional graph similarity measures. This approach has several limitations: (a) it models temporally related events as i.i.d. samples, failing to capture the non-uniform evolution of dynamic graphs; (b) it lacks a unified measure that is sensitive to both features and topology; (c) it fails to provide a scalar metric, requiring multiple metrics without clear superiority; and (d) it requires explicitly instantiating each static snapshot, leading to impractical runtime demands that hinder evaluation at scale. We propose a novel metric based on the Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma, applying random projections directly to dynamic graph data. This results in an expressive, scalar, and application-agnostic measure of dynamic graph similarity that overcomes the limitations of traditional methods.

For instance, DUSt3R recently introduced the concept of viewpoint-invariant point maps, generalizing depth prediction and showing that all key problems in the 3D reconstruction of static scenes can be reduced to predicting such point maps. In this paper, we develop an analogous concept for a very different problem: the reconstruction of the 3D shape and pose of deformable objects. To this end, we introduce Dual Point Maps (DualPM), where a pair of point maps is extracted from the same image-one associating pixels to their 3D locations on the object and the other to a canonical version of the object in its rest pose. We also extend point maps to amodal reconstruction to recover the complete shape of the object, even through self-occlusions. We show that 3D reconstruction and 3D pose estimation can be reduced to the prediction of DualPMs. Empirically, we demonstrate that this representation is a suitable target for deep networks to predict. Specifically, we focus on modeling quadrupeds, showing that DualPMs can be trained purely on synthetic 3D data, consisting of one or two models per category, while generalizing effectively to real images.

Current works further leverage 3D Gaussian Splatting as 3D representation for improved visual quality and rendering efficiency. However, we observe that existing Gaussian reconstruction models often suffer from multi-view inconsistency and blurred textures.

For instance, many LLM-like video models learn the distribution of discrete tokens derived from 3D VAEs within the VQVAE framework, while most diffusion-based video models capture the distribution of continuous latent extracted by 2D VAEs without quantization. The temporal compression is simply realized by uniform frame sampling which results in unsmooth motion between consecutive frames. Currently, there lacks of a commonly used continuous video (3D) VAE for latent diffusion-based video models in the research community. Moreover, since current diffusion-based approaches are often implemented using pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) models, directly training a video VAE without considering the compatibility with existing T2I models will result in a latent space gap between them, which will take huge computational resources for training to bridge the gap even with the T2I models as initialization. To address this issue, we propose a method for training a video VAE of latent video models, namely CV-VAE, whose latent space is compatible with that of a given image VAE, e.g., image VAE of Stable Diffusion (SD). The compatibility is achieved by the proposed novel latent space regularization, which involves formulating a regularization loss using the image VAE. Benefiting from the latent space compatibility, video models can be trained seamlessly from pre-trained T2I or video models in a truly spatio-temporally compressed latent space, rather than simply sampling video frames at equal intervals. To improve the training efficiency, we also design a novel architecture for the video VAE. With our CV-VAE, existing video models can generate four times more frames with minimal finetuning.

Conventional methods in TKGR typically depend on deep learning algorithms or temporal logical rules. However, deep learning-based TKGRs often lack interpretability, whereas rule-based TKGRs struggle to effectively learn temporal rules that capture temporal patterns. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated extensive knowledge and remarkable proficiency in temporal reasoning. Consequently, the employment of LLMs for Temporal Knowledge Graph Reasoning (TKGR) has sparked increasing interest among researchers. Nonetheless, LLMs are known to function as black boxes, making it challenging to comprehend their reasoning process. Additionally, due to the resource-intensive nature of fine-tuning, promptly updating LLMs to integrate evolving knowledge within TKGs for reasoning is impractical. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose a Large Language Models-guided Dynamic Adaptation (LLM-DA) method for reasoning on TKGs. Specifically, LLM-DA harnesses the capabilities of LLMs to analyze historical data and extract temporal logical rules. These rules unveil temporal patterns and facilitate interpretable reasoning. To account for the evolving nature of TKGs, a dynamic adaptation strategy is proposed to update the LLM-generated rules with the latest events. This ensures that the extracted rules always incorporate the most recent knowledge and better generalize to the predictions on future events. Experimental results show that without the need of fine-tuning, LLM-DA significantly improves the accuracy of reasoning over several common datasets, providing a robust framework for TKGR tasks.",2024-12-16,24,NeurIPS

Despite a surge in new PEFT methods, a systematic study to understand their performance and suitable application scenarios is lacking, leaving questions like ""when to apply PEFT"" and ""which method to use"" largely unanswered, especially in visual recognition. In this paper, we conduct a unifying empirical study of representative PEFT methods with Vision Transformers. We systematically tune their hyperparameters to fairly compare their accuracy on downstream tasks. Our study offers a practical user guide and unveils several new insights. First, if tuned carefully, different PEFT methods achieve similar accuracy in the low-shot benchmark VTAB-1K. This includes simple approaches like FT the bias terms that were reported inferior. Second, despite similar accuracy, we find that PEFT methods make different mistakes and high-confidence predictions, likely due to their different inductive biases. Such an inconsistency (or complementarity) opens up the opportunity for ensemble methods, and we make preliminary attempts at this. Third, going beyond the commonly used low-shot tasks, we find that PEFT is also useful in many-shot regimes, achieving comparable or better accuracy than full FT while using significantly fewer parameters. Lastly, we investigate PEFT's ability to preserve a pre-trained model's robustness to distribution shifts (e.g., CLIP). Perhaps not surprisingly, PEFT approaches outperform full FT alone. However, with weight-space ensembles, full FT can better balance target distribution and distribution shift performance, suggesting a future research direction for robust PEFT.",2025-06-01,5,CVPR

To this end, we first construct a large-scale (1M stereo pairs) synthetic training dataset featuring large diversity and high photorealism, followed by an automatic self-curation pipeline to remove ambiguous samples. We then design a number of network architecture components to enhance scalability, including a side-tuning feature backbone that adapts rich monocular priors from vision foundation models to mitigate the sim-to-real gap, and long-range context reasoning for effective cost volume filtering.

Recently, the strong multimodal capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have driven substantial improvements in visual grounding, though they inevitably require fine-tuning and additional model components to explicitly generate bounding boxes or segmentation masks. However, we discover that a few attention heads in frozen LVLMs demonstrate strong visual grounding capabilities. We refer to these heads, which consistently capture object locations related to text semantics, as localization heads. Using localization heads, we introduce a straightforward and effective training-free visual grounding framework that utilizes text-to-image attention maps from localization heads to identify the target objects. Surprisingly, only three out of thousands of attention heads are sufficient to achieve competitive localization performance compared to existing LVLM-based visual grounding methods that require fine-tuning. Our findings suggest that LVLMs can innately ground objects based on a deep comprehension of the text-image relationship, as they implicitly focus on relevant image regions to generate informative text outputs.

Here, we argue that solving both problems within the same framework can lead to consistent gains in accuracy and robustness. To this end, we propose a novel and flexible formulation of the operator learning problem that jointly predicts continuous quantities and infers distributions of discrete parameters, thereby amortizing the cost of both the inverse and the surrogate models to a joint pre-training step. We present the capabilities of the proposed methodology for predicting continuous and discrete biomarkers in full-body haemodynamics simulations under different levels of missing information. We also consider a test case for atmospheric large-eddy simulation of a two-dimensional dry cold bubble, where we infer both continuous time-series and information about the system's conditions.

However, most existing hashing methods are often limited by uncomprehensive feature representations and semantic associations, which greatly restricts their performance and applicability in practical applications. To deal with this challenge, in this paper, we propose an end-to-end graph attention network hashing (EGATH) for cross-modal retrieval, which can not only capture direct semantic associations between images and texts but also match semantic content between different modalities. We adopt the contrastive language image pretraining (CLIP) combined with the Transformer to improve understanding and generalization ability in semantic consistency across different data modalities. The classifier based on graph attention network is applied to obtain predicted labels to enhance cross-modal feature representation. We construct hash codes using an optimization strategy and loss function to preserve the semantic information and compactness of the hash code.

To address this limitation we propose a framework that includes a dataset collection pipeline and architectural extensions to video diffusion models to enable text-to-multi-shot video generation. Our approach enables generation of multi-shot videos as a single video with full attention across all frames of all shots, ensuring character and background consistency, and allows users to control the number, duration, and content of shots through shot-specific conditioning. This is achieved by incorporating a transition token into the text-to-video model to control at which frames a new shot begins and a local attention masking strategy which controls the transition token's effect and allows shot-specific prompting. To obtain training data we propose a novel data collection pipeline to construct a multi-shot video dataset from existing single-shot video datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that fine-tuning a pre-trained text-to-video model for a few thousand iterations is enough for the model to subsequently be able to generate multi-shot videos with shot-specific control, outperforming the baselines.

Protecting these generative models is crucial for the well-being of their owners. In this work, we propose the first method to this important yet unresolved issue, called Training data Provenance Verification (TrainProVe). The rationale behind TrainProVe is grounded in the principle of generalization error bound, which suggests that, for two models with the same task, if the distance between their training data distributions is smaller, their generalization ability will be closer. We validate the efficacy of TrainProVe across four text-to-image models (Stable Diffusion v1.4, latent consistency model, PixArt-$\alpha$, and Stable Cascade).

separating the image tasks into forgery-relevant and content-relevant components and training them without gradient interaction. Additionally, we utilize content features enhanced by
the proposed Manipulation Indicator Generator (MIG) for the

Franke, Frank Hutter, Massimiliano Pontil","Linear Recurrent Neural Networks (LRNNs) such as Mamba, RWKV, GLA, mLSTM, and DeltaNet have emerged as efficient alternatives to Transformers for long sequences. However, both Transformers and LRNNs struggle to perform state-tracking, which may impair performance in tasks such as code evaluation. In one forward pass, current architectures are unable to solve even parity, the simplest state-tracking task, which non-linear RNNs can handle effectively. Recently, Sarrof et al. (2024) demonstrated that the failure of LRNNs like Mamba to solve parity stems from restricting the value range of their diagonal state-transition matrices to $[0, 1]$ and that incorporating negative values can resolve this issue. We extend this result to non-diagonal LRNNs such as DeltaNet. We prove that finite precision LRNNs with state-transition matrices having only positive eigenvalues cannot solve parity, while non-triangular matrices are needed to count modulo $3$. Notably, we also prove that LRNNs can learn any regular language when their state-transition matrices are products of identity minus vector outer product matrices, each with eigenvalues in the range $[-1, 1]$. Our experiments confirm that extending the eigenvalue range of Mamba and DeltaNet to include negative values not only enables them to solve parity but consistently improves their performance on state-tracking tasks.

This paper introduces Scale AutoRegressive 3D (SAR3D), a novel framework that leverages a multi-scale 3D vector-quantized variational autoencoder (VQVAE) to tokenize 3D objects for efficient autoregressive generation and detailed understanding. By predicting the next scale in a multi-scale latent representation instead of the next single token, SAR3D reduces generation time significantly, achieving fast 3D object generation in just 0.82 seconds on an A6000 GPU. Additionally, given the tokens enriched with hierarchical 3D-aware information, we finetune a pretrained LLM on them, enabling multimodal comprehension of 3D content.

The deformations we recover from target normals are expressive enough to enable detailed stylizations yet restrictive enough to preserve the shape's identity. We achieve such deformations using our novel differentiable As-Rigid-As-Possible (dARAP) layer, a neural-network-ready adaptation of the classical ARAP algorithm which we use to solve for per-vertex rotations and deformed vertices.

It relaxes distributional assumptions which are difficult to verify by conditions that can be checked efficiently by a *tester*. The tester has to accept whenever the data truly satisfies the original assumptions, and the learner has to succeed whenever the tester accepts. We focus on the setting where the tester has to accept standard Gaussian data. There, it is known that basic concept classes such as halfspaces can be learned testably with the same time complexity as in the (distribution-specific) agnostic model. In this work, we ask whether there is a price to pay for testably learning more complex concept classes. In particular, we consider polynomial threshold functions (PTFs), which naturally generalize halfspaces. We show that PTFs of arbitrary constant degree can be testably learned up to excess error $\varepsilon > 0$ in time $n^{\mathrm{poly}(1/\varepsilon)}$. This qualitatively matches the best known guarantees in the agnostic model. Our results build on a connection between testable learning and *fooling*. In particular, we show that distributions that approximately match at least $\mathrm{poly}(1/\varepsilon)$ moments of the standard Gaussian fool constant-degree PTFs (up to error $\varepsilon$). As a secondary result, we prove that a direct approach to show testable learning (without fooling), which was successfully used for halfspaces, cannot work for PTFs.",2024-12-16,3,NeurIPS

In this paper, we propose EDF (emphasizes the discriminative features), a dataset distillation method that enhances key discriminative regions in synthetic images using Grad-CAM activation maps. Our approach is inspired by a key observation: in simple datasets, high-activation areas typically occupy most of the image, whereas in complex scenarios, the size of these areas is much smaller. Unlike previous methods that treat all pixels equally when synthesizing images, EDF uses Grad-CAM activation maps to enhance high-activation areas. From a supervision perspective, we downplay supervision signals that have lower losses, as they contain common patterns. Additionally, to help the DD community better explore complex scenarios, we build the Complex Dataset Distillation (Comp-DD) benchmark by meticulously selecting sixteen subsets, eight easy and eight hard, from ImageNet-1K. In particular, EDF consistently outperforms SOTA results in complex scenarios, such as ImageNet-1K subsets.

We identify an ""over-focus"" issue in existing 1D causal vision models, where attention overly concentrates on a small proportion of visual tokens. The issue of ""over-focus"" hinders the model's ability to extract diverse visual features and to receive effective gradients for optimization. To address this, we propose De-focus Attention Networks, which employ learnable bandpass filters to create varied attention patterns. During training, large and scheduled drop path rates, and an auxiliary loss on globally pooled features for global understanding tasks are introduced. These two strategies encourage the model to attend to a broader range of tokens and enhance network optimization.

The main focus of this paper is to explore the saturation effects for a large class of spectral algorithms (including the KRR, gradient descent, etc.) in large dimensional settings where $n \asymp d^{\gamma}$. More precisely, we first propose an improved minimax lower bound for the kernel regression problem in large dimensional settings and show that the gradient flow with early stopping strategy will result in an estimator achieving this lower bound (up to a logarithmic factor). Similar to the results in KRR, we can further determine the exact convergence rates (both upper and lower bounds) of a large class of (optimal tuned) spectral algorithms with different qualification $\tau$'s. In particular, we find that these exact rate curves (varying along $\gamma$) exhibit the periodic plateau behavior and the polynomial approximation barrier. Consequently, we can fully depict the saturation effects of the spectral algorithms and reveal a new phenomenon in large dimensional settings (i.e.,  the saturation effect occurs in large dimensional setting as long as the source condition $s>\tau$ while it occurs in fixed dimensional setting as long as $s>2\tau$).",2024-12-16,2,NeurIPS

A major obstacle to achieving this goal stems from the fact that graphs from different domains often exhibit diverse node features. Inspired by multi-modal models that align different modalities with natural language, the text has recently been adopted to provide a unified feature space for diverse graphs. Despite the great potential of these text-space GFMs, current research in this field is hampered by two problems. First, the absence of a comprehensive benchmark with unified problem settings hinders a clear understanding of the comparative effectiveness and practical value of different text-space GFMs. Second, there is a lack of sufficient datasets to thoroughly explore the methods' full potential and verify their effectiveness across diverse settings.

To advance research in wild animal behavior monitoring we present MammAlps, a multimodal and multi-view dataset of wildlife behavior monitoring from 9 camera-traps in the Swiss National Park. MammAlps contains over 14 hours of video with audio, 2D segmentation maps and 8.5 hours of individual tracks densely labeled for species and behavior.

In this line of research, existing methods either fail to capture the dynamic textures or incur significant overhead in terms of runtime speed or storage space. To this end, we propose a novel method that addresses all the aforementioned demands. In specific, we introduce an expressive and compact representation that encodes texture-related attributes of the 3D Gaussians in the tensorial format. We store appearance of neutral expression in static tri-planes, and represents dynamic texture details for different expressions using lightweight 1D feature lines, which are then decoded into opacity offset relative to the neutral face. We further propose adaptive truncated opacity penalty and class-balanced sampling to improve generalization across different expressions. Experiments show this design enables accurate face dynamic details capturing while maintains real-time rendering and significantly reduces storage costs, thus broadening the applicability to more scenarios.",2025-06-01,2,CVPR

Fu, Christopher Ré, David W. Romero","Visual Auto-Regressive modeling (VAR) has shown promise in bridging the speed and quality gap between autoregressive image models and diffusion models. VAR reformulates autoregressive modeling by decomposing an image into successive resolution scales. During inference, an image is generated by predicting all the tokens in the next (higher-resolution) scale, conditioned on all tokens in all previous (lower-resolution) scales. However, this formulation suffers from reduced image quality due to the parallel generation of all tokens in a resolution scale; has sequence lengths scaling superlinearly in image resolution; and requires retraining to change the sampling schedule.We introduce Hierarchical Masked Auto-Regressive modeling (HMAR), a new image generation algorithm that alleviates these issues using next-scale prediction and masked prediction to generate high-quality images with fast sampling. HMAR reformulates next-scale prediction as a Markovian process, wherein the prediction of each resolution scale is conditioned only on tokens in its immediate predecessor instead of the tokens in all predecessor resolutions. When predicting a resolution scale, HMAR uses a controllable multi-step masked generation procedure to generate a subset of the tokens in each step. On ImageNet 256x256 and 512x512 benchmarks, HMAR models match or outperform parameter-matched VAR, diffusion, and autoregressive baselines. We develop efficient IO-aware block-sparse attention kernels that allow HMAR to achieve faster training and inference times over VAR by over 2.5x and 1.75x respectively, as well as over 3x lower inference memory footprint. Finally, HMAR yields additional flexibility over VAR; its sampling schedule can be changed without further training, and it can be applied to image editing tasks in a zero-shot manner.",2025-06-01,3,CVPR

This growing interest has prompted us to explore extending this unification to videos. The core challenge lies in developing a versatile video tokenizer that captures both the spatial characteristics and temporal dynamics of videos to obtain representations for LLMs, and the representations can be further decoded into realistic video clips to enable video generation. In this work, we introduce Divot, a Diffusion-Powered Video Tokenizer, which leverages the diffusion process for self-supervised video representation learning. We posit that if a video diffusion model can effectively de-noise video clips by taking the features of a video tokenizer as the condition, then the tokenizer has successfully captured robust spatial and temporal information. Additionally, the video diffusion model inherently functions as a de-tokenizer, decoding videos from their representations. Building upon the Divot tokenizer, we present Divot-Vicuna through video-to-text autoregression and text-to-video generation by modeling the distributions of continuous-valued Divot features with a Gaussian Mixture Model. Experimental results demonstrate that our diffusion-based video tokenizer, when integrated with a pre-trained LLM, achieves competitive performance across various video comprehension and generation benchmarks.

Inspired by this observation, we introduce LT-Defense, the first searching-free backdoor defense via exploiting the long-tailed effect. Specifically, LT-Defense employs a small set of clean examples and two metrics to distinguish backdoor-related features in the target model. Upon detecting a backdoor model, LT-Defense additionally provides test-time backdoor freezing and attack target prediction.

Mixture-of-Experts (MoE), on the other side, aligns with the brain mechanism of distributed and sparse processing, resulting in an efficient way of enhancing model capacity and conditional computation. In this work, we consider how to incorporate SNNs’ spike-driven and MoE’s conditional computation into a unified framework. However, MoE uses softmax to get the dense conditional weights for each expert and TopK to hard-sparsify the network, which does not fit the properties of SNNs. To address this issue, we reformulate MoE in SNNs and introduce the Spiking Experts Mixture Mechanism (SEMM) from the perspective of sparse spiking activation. Both the experts and the router output spiking sequences, and their element-wise operation makes SEMM computation spike-driven and dynamic sparse-conditional. By developing SEMM into Spiking Transformer, the Experts Mixture Spiking Attention (EMSA) and the Experts Mixture Spiking Perceptron (EMSP) are proposed, which performs routing allocation for head-wise and channel-wise spiking experts, respectively.

Previous methods either rely on synthetic inputs and pseudo-depth labels or directly apply daytime strategies to adverse conditions, resulting in suboptimal results. In this paper, we present the first synthetic-to-real robust depth estimation framework, incorporating motion and structure priors to capture real-world knowledge effectively. In the synthetic adaptation, we transfer motion-structure knowledge inside cost volumes for better robust representation, using a frozen daytime model to train a depth estimator in synthetic adverse conditions. In the innovative real adaptation, which targets to fix synthetic-real gaps, models trained earlier identify the weather-insensitive regions with a designed consistency-reweighting strategy to emphasize valid pseudo-labels. We introduce a new regularization by gathering explicit depth distributions to constrain the model when facing real-world data.

To address this, we introduce Self Logits Evolution Decoding (SLED), a novel decoding framework that enhances the truthfulness of LLMs without relying on external knowledge bases or requiring further fine-tuning. From an optimization perspective, our SLED framework leverages the latent knowledge embedded within the LLM by contrasting the output logits from the final layer with those from early layers. It then utilizes an approximate gradient approach to enable latent knowledge to guide the self-refinement of outputs, thereby effectively improving factual accuracy. Extensive experiments have been conducted on established benchmarks across a diverse range of model families (LLaMA 2, LLaMA 3, Gemma) and scales (from 2B to 70B), including more advanced architectural configurations such as the mixture of experts (MoE). Our evaluation spans a wide variety of tasks, including multi-choice, open-generation, and adaptations to chain-of-thought reasoning tasks.

To address these challenges, we propose a rotation-equivariant regularization strategy that adaptively enforces the appropriate symmetry constraints on the data while preserving the network's representational accuracy. Specifically, we introduce EQ-Reg, a regularizer designed to enhance rotation equivariance, which innovatively extends the insights of data-augmentation-based and equivariant-based methodologies. This is achieved through self-supervised learning and the spatial rotation and cyclic channel shift of feature maps deduce in the equivariant framework.

We solve these problems with M-GAM, a sparse, generalized, additive modeling approach that incorporates missingness indicators and their interaction terms while maintaining sparsity through $\ell_0$ regularization.

It is well understood that solely using observational data, one can only orient the causal graph up to its Markov equivalence class, necessitating interventional data to learn the complete causal graph. Most works in the literature design causal discovery policies with perfect interventions, i.e., they have access to infinite interventional samples. This study considers a Bayesian approach for learning causal graphs with limited interventional samples, mirroring real-world scenarios where such samples are usually costly to obtain. By leveraging the recent result of Wienöbst et al. [2023] on uniform DAG sampling in polynomial time, we can efficiently enumerate all the cut configurations and their corresponding interventional distributions of a target set, and further track their posteriors. Given any number of interventional samples, our proposed algorithm randomly intervenes on a set of target vertices that cut all the edges in the graph and returns a causal graph according to the posterior of each target set. When the number of interventional samples is large enough, we show theoretically that our proposed algorithm will return the true causal graph with high probability. We compare our algorithm against various baseline methods on simulated datasets, demonstrating its superior accuracy measured by the structural Hamming distance between the learned DAG and the ground truth. Additionally, we present a case study showing how this algorithm could be modified to answer more general causal questions without learning the whole graph.

Recent works address this problem by applying a video diffusion model to generate video depth conditioned on the input video, which is training-expensive and can only produce scale-invariant depth values without camera poses. In this paper, we propose a novel video-depth estimation method called Align3R to estimate temporal consistent depth maps for a dynamic video. Our key idea is to utilize the recent DUSt3R model to align estimated monocular depth maps of different timesteps. First, we fine-tune the DUSt3R model with additional estimated monocular depth as inputs for the dynamic scenes. Then, we apply optimization to reconstruct both depth maps and camera poses. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Align3R estimates consistent video depth and camera poses for a monocular video with superior performance than baseline methods.",2025-06-01,31,CVPR

The scene graph encodes the relationships between objects, groups and rooms with a LLM-friendly structure, for which we design a hierarchical chain-of-thought prompt to help LLM reason the goal location according to scene context by traversing the nodes and edges.Moreover, benefit from the scene graph representation, we further design a re-perception mechanism to empower the object navigation framework with the ability to correct perception error.We conduct extensive experiments on MP3D, HM3D and RoboTHOR environments, where SG-Nav surpasses previous state-of-the-art zero-shot methods by more than \textbf{10\%} SR on all benchmarks, while the decision process is explainable. To the best of our knowledge, SG-Nav is the first zero-shot method that achieves even higher performance than supervised object navigation methods on the challenging MP3D benchmark.Code of this project will be released in the final version.",2024-12-16,46,NeurIPS

In this work, we study if visual representations of sub-goals implied by the instructions can serve as navigational cues and lead to increased navigation performance. To synthesize these visual representations or imaginations, we leverage a text-to-image diffusion model on landmark references contained in segmented instructions. These imaginations are provided to VLN agents as an added modality to act as landmark cues and an auxiliary loss is added to explicitly encourage relating these with their corresponding referring expressions. Our findings reveal an increase in success rate (SR) of around 1 point and up to 0.5 points in success scaled by inverse path length (SPL) across agents. These results suggest that the proposed approach reinforces visual understanding compared to relying on language instructions alone.

However, its reliability is compromised by the CoT reasoning’s inability to capture comprehensive and deeper details, often leading to incomplete outcomes. Existing methods mainly rely on majority voting or criteria expansion, which is insufficient to address the limitation in CoT. We propose Crowd-based Comparative Evaluation, which introduces additional crowd responses to compare with the candidate responses, thereby exposing deeper and more comprehensive details within the candidate responses. This process effectively guides LLM-as-a-Judge to provide a more detailed CoT judgment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach enhances evaluation reliability, achieving an average accuracy gain of 6.7% across five benchmarks. Moreover, our method produces higher-quality CoTs that facilitate judge distillation and exhibit superior performance in rejection sampling for supervised fine-tuning (SFT), referred to as crowd rejection sampling, thereby enabling more efficient SFT. Our analysis confirms that CoTs generated by ours are more comprehensive and of higher quality, and evaluation accuracy improves as inference scales.",2025-07-01,5,ACL

				658-666","Continual Learning (CL) for malware classification tackles the rapidly evolving nature of malware threats and the frequent emergence of new types. Generative Replay (GR)-based CL systems utilize a generative model to produce synthetic versions of past data, which are then combined with new data to retrain the primary model. Traditional machine learning techniques in this domain often struggle with catastrophic forgetting, where a model's performance on old data degrades over time.

In this paper, we introduce a GR-based CL system that employs Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) with feature matching loss to generate high-quality malware samples. Additionally, we implement innovative selection schemes for replay samples based on the model’s hidden representations.

Our comprehensive evaluation across Windows and Android malware datasets in a class-incremental learning scenario -- where new classes are introduced continuously over multiple tasks -- demonstrates substantial performance improvements over previous methods. For example, our system achieves an average accuracy of 55% on Windows malware samples, significantly outperforming other GR-based models by 28%. This study provides practical insights for advancing GR-based malware classification systems.",2025-04-11,6,AAAI

Existing approaches through building compositional architectures or generating difficult negative captions often assume a fixed prespecified compositional structure, which limits generalization to new distributions. In this paper, we argue that curriculum training is crucial to equipping generative models with a fundamental understanding of compositionality. To achieve this, we leverage large-language models (LLMs) to automatically compose complex scenarios and harness Visual-Question Answering (VQA) checkers to automatically curate a contrastive dataset, ConPair, consisting of 15k pairs of high-quality contrastive images. These pairs feature minimal visual discrepancies and cover a wide range of attribute categories, especially complex and natural scenarios. To learn effectively from these error cases (i.e., hard negative images), we propose EvoGen, a new multi-stage curriculum for contrastive learning of diffusion models. Through extensive experiments across a wide range of compositional scenarios, we showcase the effectiveness of our proposed framework on compositional T2I benchmarks.",2024-10-04,6,ICLR

Contemporary learning-based planning approaches such as imitation learning methods often struggle to balance competing objectives and lack of safety assurance,due to limited adaptability and inadequacy in learning complex multi-modal behaviors commonly exhibited in human planning, not to mention their strong reliance on the fallback strategy with predefined rules. We propose a novel transformer-based Diffusion Planner for closed-loop planning, which can effectively model multi-modal driving behavior and ensure trajectory quality without any rule-based refinement. Our model supports joint modeling of both prediction and planning tasks under the same architecture, enabling cooperative behaviors between vehicles. Moreover, by learning the gradient of the trajectory score function and employing a flexible classifier guidance mechanism, Diffusion Planner effectively achieves safe and adaptable planning behaviors. Evaluations on the large-scale real-world autonomous planning benchmark nuPlan and our newly collected 200-hour delivery-vehicle driving dataset demonstrate that Diffusion Planner achieves state-of-the-art closed-loop performance with robust transferability in diverse driving styles.",2024-10-04,33,ICLR

While the existing MGT detectors achieve strong performance, they remain vulnerable to simple perturbations and adversarial attacks. To build an effective defense against malicious perturbations, we view MGT detection from a threat modeling perspective, that is, analyzing the model’s vulnerability from an adversary’s point of view and exploring effective mitigations. To this end, we introduce an adversarial framework for training a robust MGT detector, named GREedy Adversary PromoTed DefendER (GREATER). The GREATER consists of two key components: an adversary GREATER-A and a detector GREATER-D. The GREATER-D learns to defend against the adversarial attack from GREATER-A and generalizes the defense to other attacks. GREATER-A identifies and perturbs the critical tokens in embedding space, along with greedy search and pruning to generate stealthy and disruptive adversarial examples. Besides, we update the GREATER-A and GREATER-D synchronously, encouraging the GREATER-D to generalize its defense to different attacks and varying attack intensities. Our experimental results across 10 text perturbation strategies and 6 adversarial attacks show that our GREATER-D reduces the Attack Success Rate (ASR) by 0.67% compared with SOTA defense methods while our GREATER-A is demonstrated to be more effective and efficient than SOTA attack approaches.
